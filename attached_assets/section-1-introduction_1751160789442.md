# Introduction to Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Radiation Oncology

Radiation oncology is a vital discipline within the broader field of oncology, dedicated to the use of ionizing radiation for the treatment of malignant and select benign diseases. Since its inception following the discovery of X-rays and radioactivity in the late 19th century, the field has evolved into a highly specialized and technologically advanced domain. It combines fundamental principles of physics, biology, and clinical medicine to achieve effective tumor control while minimizing harm to healthy tissue.

This chapter provides a comprehensive foundation in the essential scientific and conceptual frameworks of radiation oncology. A thorough understanding of these fundamentals is crucial not only for radiation oncologists but also for multidisciplinary team members involved in the care of cancer patients.

The chapter begins with an overview of the **history and evolution of radiation therapy**, highlighting milestones from the early use of radium to the development of linear accelerators and sophisticated imaging-guided techniques. Recognizing the historical context offers valuable insights into how modern practices have emerged and why certain protocols exist.

The next section addresses **basic radiation physics**, a cornerstone of treatment planning and delivery. This includes the nature and types of ionizing radiation (photons, electrons, and particle beams), the concept of dose and its units (Gray, centigray), and the mechanisms by which radiation interacts with biological tissues. The physics of radiation determines how beams are shaped, targeted, and measured — all critical to achieving therapeutic goals.

A detailed exploration of **radiation biology** follows, examining how ionizing radiation induces DNA damage, how cells respond through repair mechanisms, and what factors influence radiosensitivity. Central to this discussion are the “Four R’s” of radiobiology—repair, repopulation, redistribution, and reoxygenation—which help explain the rationale behind fractionation and scheduling in clinical practice. The section also introduces the linear-quadratic model, a key concept used to predict cell survival and optimize dose regimens.

Together, these three components—history, physics, and biology—form the intellectual foundation of the discipline. They provide the basis for advanced topics such as treatment planning, modality selection, dose constraint formulation, and integration with systemic therapy.

The goal of this chapter is to equip the reader with a solid conceptual framework that supports clinical reasoning and fosters an appreciation for the multidisciplinary and evidence-based nature of radiation oncology. Whether one is a trainee building foundational knowledge or a practicing clinician revisiting key principles, these fundamentals underpin the safe and effective use of radiation in cancer treatment.
