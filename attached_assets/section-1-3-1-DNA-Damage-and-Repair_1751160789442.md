# 1.3.1 DNA Damage and Repair

## Introduction

The biological impact of ionizing radiation in cancer therapy is fundamentally driven by its ability to damage DNA. While radiation can interact with many cellular structures, the most lethal and clinically relevant damage occurs at the level of the genome. Failure to repair such damage can lead to cell death, genomic instability, or permanent loss of reproductive integrityâ€”all key goals in tumor control.

Radiation-induced DNA damage can occur directly through ionization of the DNA molecule or indirectly through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The nature, frequency, and reparability of the damage determine cellular fate. This section explores the types of DNA lesions induced by radiation, the cellular repair pathways involved, and their implications for radiotherapy efficacy and resistance.

## 1. Mechanisms of Radiation-Induced DNA Damage

Radiation deposits energy in tissue either:

- **Directly**, by ionizing the DNA molecule itself
- **Indirectly**, by ionizing water molecules, which then produce ROS (e.g., hydroxyl radicals)

### Relative Contributions

- **Low LET radiation** (e.g., X-rays, gamma rays): ~70% of DNA damage is indirect
- **High LET radiation** (e.g., carbon ions, alpha particles): predominantly direct DNA ionization

Indirect damage dominates in conventional radiotherapy and is more dependent on the presence of oxygen (oxygen enhancement effect).

## 2. Types of DNA Damage

Radiation causes a spectrum of DNA lesions:

### 1. **Base Damage**
- Loss or modification of nucleotides
- Often repaired efficiently but may contribute to mutations if unrepaired

### 2. **Single-Strand Breaks (SSBs)**
- Breaks in one strand of the DNA double helix
- Common and usually repaired quickly using the undamaged strand as a template

### 3. **Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs)**
- Simultaneous breaks in both DNA strands
- **Most lethal lesion** associated with cell death
- Can lead to chromosomal aberrations or misrepair

### 4. **DNA Crosslinks**
- Covalent links between DNA strands or between DNA and proteins
- Can obstruct replication and transcription

DSBs and complex clustered damage are particularly associated with high LET radiation and are less amenable to repair.

## 3. Cellular DNA Repair Pathways

Cells have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to detect and repair DNA lesions. These include:

### A. **Base Excision Repair (BER)**
- Repairs small, non-helix-distorting base lesions and SSBs
- Initiated by DNA glycosylases
- Active throughout the cell cycle

### B. **Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)**
- Removes bulky helix-distorting lesions (e.g., thymine dimers)
- Involves removal of a short single-stranded DNA segment
- More relevant for UV damage than ionizing radiation

### C. **Mismatch Repair (MMR)**
- Corrects base-pair mismatches and small insertion/deletion loops
- Important for replication fidelity

### D. **Double-Strand Break Repair**

#### 1. **Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ)**
- **Dominant DSB repair pathway in human cells**
- Joins broken DNA ends directly without needing sequence homology
- Error-prone: can result in insertions, deletions, or translocations
- Active throughout the cell cycle, especially in G1

#### 2. **Homologous Recombination (HR)**
- Uses an undamaged sister chromatid as a template for accurate repair
- High-fidelity but restricted to S and G2 phases
- Critical in the repair of complex or clustered DNA damage

**Clinical Note**: Tumors with defective HR (e.g., BRCA1/2 mutations) are more sensitive to radiation and DNA-damaging agents and may benefit from **PARP inhibitors**.

## 4. Factors Affecting Repair Efficiency

### Cell Cycle Phase
- NHEJ predominates in G1 phase
- HR is active in S/G2 when sister chromatids are available

### Radiation Type
- **Low LET**: Produces isolated, repairable damage
- **High LET**: Produces complex, clustered damage that overwhelms repair machinery

### Oxygenation
- Well-oxygenated cells form fixed DNA lesions due to ROS
- Hypoxic cells are more radioresistant due to reduced indirect damage

### Genetic Status
- Defects in repair genes (e.g., ATM, p53, BRCA) alter cellular radiosensitivity
- Tumors with high intrinsic repair capacity may resist radiation therapy

## 5. Clinical Implications

### Radiosensitization
- Drugs that inhibit DNA repair (e.g., **PARP inhibitors**, **DNA-PK inhibitors**) can enhance tumor response
- Especially useful in **HR-deficient tumors**

### Tumor Resistance
- Upregulation of repair proteins (e.g., RAD51, Ku70/80) may mediate resistance
- Repeated radiation exposure can select for more repair-proficient clones

### Normal Tissue Toxicity
- Genetic predisposition (e.g., **ataxia telangiectasia**) increases radiation sensitivity and limits dose tolerances

## 6. Research Directions and Targeted Therapies

- **Synthetic lethality**: Exploiting tumor-specific repair deficiencies to selectively enhance damage
- **DNA repair biomarkers**: Predicting radiosensitivity and guiding personalized therapy
- **Combination therapies**: Merging radiation with checkpoint inhibitors or DNA damage response inhibitors

## Conclusion

DNA damage and repair are central to the biological action of radiation therapy. While most normal tissues can effectively repair sublethal injury, tumor cells often harbor deficiencies in these pathways that can be therapeutically exploited. A thorough understanding of these mechanisms enhances the ability to design effective, individualized treatment plans, identify radiosensitizers, and minimize toxicity.
