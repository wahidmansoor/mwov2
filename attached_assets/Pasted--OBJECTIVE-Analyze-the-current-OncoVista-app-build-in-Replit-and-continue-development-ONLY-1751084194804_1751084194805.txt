// 🔍 OBJECTIVE:
// Analyze the current OncoVista app build in Replit and continue development ONLY as a clinical decision-support system — NOT an EHR.
// This app is built to serve as a comprehensive oncology guidance tool for trainees and oncologists at all stages — not for recording or storing patient records.

// ❌ DO NOT:
// - Add real-time patient charting, hospital admissions, or dynamic EHR features
// - Build a system for hospital billing, medication orders, or patient-specific identifiers
// - Assume clinical data entry or storage is needed for real patients

// ✅ DO:
// - Build modular, interactive, and AI-enhanced educational tools
// - Provide protocols, pathways, calculators, alerts, and clinical summaries
// - Use dummy/mock data only where simulations are required (e.g., treatment examples)

// 📦 MODULE GOALS:
// I want you to now analyze what has been built in Replit and guide me to COMPLETE only the following missing parts:
// 1. Inpatient Oncology Module — with admission protocols, emergency regimens, and monitoring workflows
2. AI Chat Assistant — for answering guideline questions, not for storing patient info
3. Notes Export — generate summaries or mock progress notes only for demonstration
4. Tools Bar — with calculators, alerts, lab guides
5. Analytics Dashboard — showing guideline usage, not patient stats

// 📂 STRUCTURE:
// All modules should follow the existing OPD, CDU, and Handbook folder structure
// Use React + TypeScript + Tailwind + ShadCN + Lucide icons
// Supabase can be used for static content, but no patient info should be stored

// 📌 EXAMPLE TASK TO START WITH:
// Build the missing Inpatient Oncology Module (src/modules/inpatient/InpatientModule.tsx)
// Features: admission checklist, triage-based investigations, supportive care guides
// Use tab-based layout with modular cards and color-coded alerts

// 📣 PLEASE:
// Before generating full components, give a breakdown of suggested file structure, subcomponents, and what each part will do — to ensure it matches our non-EHR design
