# 1.1 History and Evolution of Radiation Therapy

## Introduction

Radiation therapy (RT) is a cornerstone of modern cancer treatment, employed in over 50% of all cancer patients during their care. Its evolution has been shaped by advances in physics, biology, engineering, and clinical medicine. Understanding the historical development of radiation therapy provides essential context for the techniques, technologies, and clinical strategies in use today.

## Early Discoveries and Foundations

The origins of radiation therapy are rooted in the discovery of ionizing radiation in the late 19th century:

- **1895** – Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen discovered X-rays, revolutionizing diagnostic medicine.
- **1896** – Henri Becquerel discovered natural radioactivity in uranium.
- **1898** – Marie and Pierre Curie isolated radium, paving the way for therapeutic applications.

Shortly after these discoveries, clinicians began experimenting with radiation for treating benign and malignant diseases. In 1896, the first documented use of X-rays for skin cancer was reported, initiating the era of therapeutic radiology.

## The Radium Era and Early Clinical Use

The early 20th century saw rapid adoption of **radium** for intracavitary and surface applications:

- Radium was initially applied without shielding or dose regulation, leading to frequent injuries and complications.
- The term **brachytherapy** (from the Greek "brachy" meaning "short") emerged to describe close-contact treatment with radioactive sources.

During this period, radiation was used for both malignant and benign conditions, often with crude methods. Dosimetry was poorly understood, and biological effects were underappreciated.

## Rise of External Beam Therapy and Cobalt Machines

The 1950s marked a major shift in radiation oncology with the development of **teletherapy units**, particularly **cobalt-60 machines**, which emitted gamma rays and allowed for deeper tumor treatment.

- **Cobalt-60 units** replaced radium and early orthovoltage machines.
- They enabled better skin sparing and greater dose delivery to internal malignancies.
- Their reliability and lower cost led to widespread global use, especially in resource-limited settings.

## Advent of Linear Accelerators (LINACs)

The introduction of **medical linear accelerators (LINACs)** in the 1960s–1970s allowed production of high-energy X-rays (megavoltage), offering multiple advantages:

- Improved dose distribution and normal tissue sparing
- Capability to generate electron beams for superficial treatment
- Enabled beam shaping and depth targeting

LINACs quickly became the global standard for external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), replacing cobalt-based systems in most advanced centers.

## Imaging and Simulation Advances

The 1980s–1990s brought integration of diagnostic imaging into radiation planning:

- **Computed tomography (CT)** simulation allowed 3D visualization of anatomy.
- CT-based **treatment planning systems (TPS)** introduced **3D conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT)**.
- Image fusion with **MRI and PET** further refined target delineation.

Simulation evolved from fluoroscopic techniques to fully digital platforms, significantly improving accuracy and reproducibility.

## Modern Techniques and Innovations

### Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT)

- Emerged in the late 1990s.
- Utilizes dynamic multileaf collimators (MLCs) to modulate beam intensity.
- Achieves conformal dose distributions with reduced exposure to organs at risk (OARs).
- Widely used in head and neck, prostate, and gynecologic cancers.

### Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT)

- Involves real-time imaging (e.g., cone-beam CT) during treatment.
- Ensures accurate targeting of mobile or deformable tumors.
- Enhances safety in hypofractionated and stereotactic regimens.

### Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)

- Deliver high-dose radiation in 1–5 fractions with sub-millimeter precision.
- Used in brain metastases, spine, lung, liver, and prostate tumors.
- Require rigid immobilization and advanced image guidance.

### Adaptive Radiation Therapy (ART)

- Modifies the treatment plan during the course of therapy based on anatomic or biologic changes.
- Emerging use of AI, deformable registration, and daily imaging to personalize dosing.

## Particle Therapy

Particle therapy introduces charged particles for treatment:

- **Proton therapy**: Delivers energy via a Bragg peak, minimizing exit dose. Ideal for pediatric and select adult tumors.
- **Carbon ion therapy**: High-LET modality with greater biological effect, limited to specialized centers.
- Ongoing trials are evaluating comparative outcomes and cost-effectiveness.

## Safety, QA, and Standardization

As techniques became more sophisticated, the importance of **quality assurance (QA)** and **radiation safety** grew:

- Treatment planning and delivery require multi-disciplinary checks.
- Formal training for radiation oncologists, physicists, and dosimetrists became standardized.
- Guidelines from AAPM, ESTRO, and IAEA established protocols for safe practice.

## Global Impact and Access

While high-income countries benefit from advanced techniques, access to radiation therapy remains limited in many low- and middle-income regions:

- The **Lancet Oncology Commission** highlighted a large global deficit in RT infrastructure.
- Efforts are ongoing to improve availability, affordability, and equity in global cancer care.

## Conclusion

Radiation therapy has evolved dramatically over the past century, transitioning from unshielded radium applications to highly precise, image-guided, and biologically informed treatments. Continued innovation in physics, imaging, biology, and informatics promises to further refine cancer care. However, global disparities in access remain a challenge, underscoring the importance of technology dissemination and policy support.
