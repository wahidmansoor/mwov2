I need to enhance my React/TypeScript Treatment Plan Selector application based on a comprehensive audit. Please implement the following critical improvements in priority order:
ðŸ”´ IMMEDIATE PRIORITY (P0) - Must Fix
1. API Resilience & Offline Capability

Current Issue: Single point of failure with no offline fallback
Fix Needed:

Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for /api/generate-recommendation calls
Add service worker for caching NCCN protocols locally
Create progressive fallback strategy: API â†’ Local Cache â†’ Basic Rule Engine
Add timeout handling (30s max) with graceful degradation



typescript// Target Implementation Pattern
const useResilientRecommendations = (criteria) => {
  // Implement: API â†’ Cache â†’ Fallback â†’ Error state progression
}
2. Enhanced Error Handling & Recovery

Current Issue: Basic error handling with no recovery mechanisms
Fix Needed:

Wrap components in error boundaries with recovery options
Implement circuit breaker pattern for API calls
Add user-friendly error messages with suggested actions
Create "retry" and "work offline" options



3. Clinical Audit Trail System

Current Issue: No logging of clinical decisions
Fix Needed:

Log all recommendation requests with timestamp, criteria, and results
Store decision rationale and confidence scores
Implement export functionality for audit logs
Add user session tracking for clinical accountability



ðŸŸ¡ HIGH PRIORITY (P1) - Enhance Core Features
4. Advanced Biomarker Conflict Detection

Current Issue: Basic exclusion rules only
Enhancement Needed:

Implement complex biomarker interaction matrix
Add resistance mutation tracking (EGFR T790M, KRAS G12C, etc.)
Create temporal biomarker evolution support
Add cross-cancer biomarker interaction warnings



5. Dynamic Performance Status Integration

Current Issue: Hard-coded PS=1, no filtering
Fix Needed:

Remove hard-coded PS values from API calls
Filter protocols based on selected ECOG PS (0-4)
Implement PS-specific dose modifications
Add functional assessment warnings for PS â‰¥2



6. Real-time Evidence Integration

Current Issue: Static NCCN references
Enhancement Needed:

Add evidence recency scoring (prefer <6 months data)
Implement dynamic guideline version checking
Create evidence level weighting (Category 1 > 2A > 2B)
Add "guideline update available" notifications



ðŸŸ¢ MEDIUM PRIORITY (P2) - User Experience
7. Enhanced Export Capabilities

Current: Basic PDF/JSON export only
Add:

FHIR R4-compliant clinical data export
Structured clinical decision summary reports
Multi-format support (PDF, DOCX, HL7)
Integration-ready API response formats



8. Advanced UI/UX Features

Add:

Save/load commonly used criteria combinations
Side-by-side treatment option comparison
Treatment timeline/schedule visualization
Severity-weighted clinical alerts (red/yellow/green)



SPECIFIC TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
Database Enhancements Needed:
sql-- Create these missing tables:
CREATE TABLE treatment_outcomes_data (...);
CREATE TABLE drug_interaction_matrix (...);
CREATE TABLE biomarker_resistance_patterns (...);
Frontend Architecture Fixes:

Eliminate prop drilling in criteria passing
Resolve localStorage/React Query state conflicts
Decouple input validation from API calls
Add comprehensive TypeScript error handling

API Route Improvements:

Optimize /api/generate-recommendation for performance
Add /api/protocols/cache for offline data
Implement /api/audit/log for decision tracking
Create /api/biomarkers/interactions endpoint

CURRENT COMPONENT STRUCTURE TO ENHANCE:
TreatmentPlanSelector/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx (main orchestration)
â”œâ”€â”€ EnhancedInputPanel.tsx (criteria collection)
â”œâ”€â”€ RecommendationPanel.tsx (results display)
â”œâ”€â”€ ExportPanel.tsx (PDF/data export)
â””â”€â”€ types.ts (TypeScript definitions)
SUCCESS CRITERIA:

âœ… Application works offline with cached protocols
âœ… API failures gracefully degrade to local recommendations
âœ… Complex biomarker interactions properly detected and warned
âœ… Performance status dynamically filters available protocols
âœ… All clinical decisions logged with full audit trail
âœ… FHIR-compliant data export capability
âœ… Evidence recency properly weighted in recommendations

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:

Test offline functionality with network disabled
Verify API failure recovery with simulated timeouts
Validate biomarker conflict detection with complex cases
Confirm audit logging captures all decision points

Please implement these enhancements systematically, starting with P0 items. Focus on maintaining the existing 75+ cancer type support and NCCN alignment while adding these critical missing features.
