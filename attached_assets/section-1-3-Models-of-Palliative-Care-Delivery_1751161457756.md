# 1.3 Models of Palliative Care Delivery

## Introduction

Palliative care is not confined to a single specialty or location—it is a flexible and scalable model of care that can be adapted to meet the needs of patients across diverse clinical settings. To meet growing demand, modern palliative care is delivered through a variety of models that reflect differences in disease trajectory, resource availability, care setting, and provider expertise.

This section outlines the major models of palliative care delivery, including the distinction between primary and specialty palliative care, and the implementation of services across inpatient, outpatient, home-based, and community settings. Understanding these models allows clinicians and health systems to provide timely, patient-centered care and improve access across the continuum of illness.

## 1. Primary vs. Specialty Palliative Care

### A. Primary Palliative Care

Also referred to as “generalist” palliative care, this is the **basic level of palliative care** delivered by non-specialists, such as:

- Primary care physicians
- Oncologists
- Hospitalists
- Nurses and allied health professionals

**Core competencies include:**

- Basic symptom management (e.g., pain, nausea, dyspnea)
- Communication about goals of care and prognosis
- Advance care planning discussions
- Psychosocial support and caregiver guidance

Primary palliative care ensures that all patients receive a baseline standard of comfort-oriented care, even when access to palliative specialists is limited. Training in primary palliative care is increasingly integrated into medical education and hospital protocols.

### B. Specialty Palliative Care

This is provided by an **interdisciplinary team** of trained professionals with expertise in complex symptom management, high-stakes communication, and ethical decision-making. Teams typically include:

- Palliative care physicians and nurse practitioners
- Nurses and case managers
- Social workers
- Chaplains or spiritual counselors
- Pharmacists
- Psychologists or grief counselors

**Indications for specialty-level involvement:**

- Complex or refractory symptoms (e.g., opioid titration, intractable pain)
- High emotional or existential distress
- Family conflict or decisional uncertainty
- Advanced care planning for medically complex cases
- Transition to hospice or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment

Early referral to specialty palliative care is associated with better symptom control, improved patient satisfaction, and in some cases, longer survival.

## 2. Inpatient Palliative Care

Inpatient models are embedded in hospitals and provide consultation or dedicated care to hospitalized patients.

### A. Consultation Teams

- Offer expert recommendations to the primary treating team
- Address symptom control, goals of care, discharge planning
- Often serve as facilitators of family meetings and ethics consults

### B. Inpatient Palliative Care Units (PCUs)

- Dedicated units focusing on intensive symptom control or end-of-life care
- Staffed by palliative care teams with 24/7 coverage
- Serve as alternatives to ICU admission for appropriate patients

Inpatient teams play a critical role in initiating or coordinating transitions to home-based care or hospice.

## 3. Outpatient Palliative Care

Outpatient clinics deliver longitudinal palliative care to patients with serious illness who are not hospitalized.

- Often co-located with oncology, cardiology, or other specialty clinics
- Provide regular follow-up for symptom management, psychological support, and care planning
- Enable **early integration**, which improves quality of life and can reduce emergency visits and hospitalizations

Outpatient models are essential for supporting patients through prolonged illness trajectories, including cancer, heart failure, and COPD.

## 4. Home-Based Palliative Care

Home-based models extend palliative services to patients who are homebound or prefer to remain in their familiar environment.

**Services may include:**

- Physician or nurse practitioner home visits
- Symptom assessment and medication adjustment
- Coordination with home health aides and hospice services
- Virtual care (telepalliative care) to support access in rural or underserved areas

Studies show that home-based palliative care improves patient satisfaction, reduces caregiver burden, and often results in fewer hospital deaths.

## 5. Long-Term Care and Nursing Facility Integration

Palliative care is increasingly embedded in **skilled nursing facilities (SNFs)** and assisted living environments.

- Provides continuity for residents with complex care needs
- Offers support for staff in managing symptoms and addressing goals of care
- Facilitates smooth transitions to hospice when appropriate

Some models include **embedded palliative care nurse practitioners** who round regularly in facilities.

## 6. Community-Based and Population Health Models

Innovative models have extended palliative care beyond traditional venues:

- **Community paramedic programs** for symptom crises
- **Public health initiatives** to train volunteers in compassionate care
- **Integrated delivery networks (IDNs)** that stratify patients by risk and automatically flag those who may benefit from palliative input

These models are particularly valuable in resource-limited settings and for populations with limited access to institutional care.

## 7. Telepalliative Care

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of **telehealth platforms** for delivering palliative care.

Benefits include:

- Improved access in remote or underserved areas
- Flexibility for patients with mobility limitations
- Ongoing monitoring and symptom support between in-person visits

Challenges include technological barriers, licensing restrictions, and the need for training in virtual communication skills.

## 8. Pediatric Palliative Care Models

Pediatric palliative care has specialized models recognizing the unique developmental, emotional, and family needs of children with serious illness.

- Delivered in hospitals, outpatient clinics, and in the home
- Integrates child life specialists and developmental counselors
- Offers support throughout the illness—not only end of life

Pediatric programs often collaborate with neonatology, oncology, and genetics services.

## Conclusion

Palliative care delivery is multifaceted and adaptable. Whether provided by a primary care clinician managing basic symptoms or a specialty team navigating complex ethical decisions, the goal remains the same: to relieve suffering and support patients and families through the course of serious illness. Understanding and implementing various models of delivery allows health systems to extend palliative care equitably, sustainably, and effectively across all populations and settings.
