# 1.2.1 Genetic and Epigenetic Mechanisms

## Introduction

Epigenetics encompasses heritable yet reversible modifications to gene expression that do not alter the DNA sequence. These modifications regulate chromatin accessibility and transcriptional activity. In cancer, aberrant epigenetic regulation contributes directly to initiation, progression, immune evasion, and resistance to therapy. Unlike fixed genetic mutations, epigenetic changes are reversible, making them attractive targets for diagnostics and therapy.

**Major mechanisms include:**

- DNA methylation  
- Histone modifications  
- Chromatin remodeling  
- Noncoding RNAs  
- Genomic imprinting

These act together to reshape gene expression patterns in cancer, silencing tumor suppressor genes and activating oncogenes.

## 1. DNA Methylation in Cancer

### Mechanism

- Occurs at CpG dinucleotides, especially in gene promoters.  
- DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A/B) mediate methylation.  
- Leads to transcriptional silencing by blocking transcription factor access and compacting chromatin.

### Role in Tumorigenesis

#### Global Hypomethylation

- Induces genomic instability  
- Activates oncogenes and transposable elements  
- Associated with aneuploidy and chromosomal instability (CIN)

#### Promoter Hypermethylation

- Silences tumor suppressor genes (e.g., MLH1 → MSI, BRCA1, CDKN2A)

### Clinical Implications

**Diagnostics:**

- SEPT9 → colorectal cancer screening  
- GSTP1 → prostate cancer

**Therapeutics:**

- DNMT inhibitors: Azacitidine, decitabine  
- Approved for MDS and AML

## 2. Histone Modifications in Cancer

### Basic Concepts

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histone tails regulate DNA accessibility and gene transcription.

### Common Modifications

| Modification    | Enzyme           | Effect on Transcription             |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Acetylation     | HATs/HDACs       | Activation (open chromatin)         |
| Methylation     | HMTs/HDMs        | Activation or repression (context)  |
| Phosphorylation | Kinases          | DNA repair, signaling                |
| Ubiquitination  | E3 ligases       | Regulation or degradation           |
| Sumoylation     | SUMO ligases     | Repression                          |

### Oncogenic Dysregulation

- **EZH2** (H3K27 methylation): Overexpressed/mutated in various cancers  
- **H3 mutations**: Pediatric gliomas (H3F3A), chondroblastoma  
- Loss of H3K27me3 in DIPG due to H3K27M mutation

### Therapeutics

- HDAC inhibitors: Vorinostat, romidepsin (T-cell lymphomas)  
- EZH2 inhibitor: Tazemetostat (EZH2-mutant lymphoma)  
- BET inhibitors (BRD4): Under trial (NUT carcinoma, AML)

## 3. Noncoding RNAs and Epigenetic Regulation

### MicroRNAs (miRNAs)

- ~22-nt RNAs that degrade mRNAs or inhibit translation  
- **miR-21**: Oncogenic (targets PTEN)  
- **miR-34a**: Tumor suppressor (targets BCL2, CDK6)

### Long Noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)

- >200 nt; regulate transcription and chromatin  
- **HOTAIR**: Recruits PRC2, LSD1  
- **MALAT1**: Correlates with metastasis

### PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs)

- Silence transposable elements  
- Roles emerging in somatic tumors

**Clinical Utility:**

- miRNA profiles aid diagnosis  
- miRNA-targeting drugs (e.g., MRX34) in development

## 4. X Chromosome Inactivation and Cancer

- **XIST** lncRNA silences one X chromosome in females  
- Loss of XIST → reactivation of oncogenes  
- Linked to breast, ovarian cancers, hematologic malignancies

---

## 5. Genomic Imprinting

Monoallelic gene expression based on parental origin, maintained by differential methylation.

**Loss of imprinting (LOI):**

- Leads to overexpression of growth genes (e.g., IGF2 in Wilms tumor)

| Syndrome               | Genes Affected        | Tumor Risk                        |
|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Beckwith-Wiedemann     | IGF2, CDKN1C           | Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma       |
| Silver-Russell         | IGF2 hypomethylation   | Reduced growth, low cancer risk   |
| Prader-Willi/Angelman  | Chr 15q11–13           | Rare malignancies                 |
