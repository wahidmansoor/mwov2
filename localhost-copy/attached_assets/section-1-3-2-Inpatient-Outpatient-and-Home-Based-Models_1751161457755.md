# 1.3.2 Inpatient, Outpatient, and Home-Based Models

## Introduction

Palliative care is a flexible and scalable approach designed to meet the needs of patients with serious illness across diverse settings. While the philosophy of care remains consistent—focused on symptom management, quality of life, and psychosocial support—the delivery models vary depending on clinical context, resource availability, and patient preference.

This section explores the three primary models of palliative care delivery: **inpatient**, **outpatient**, and **home-based**. Each has distinct advantages, challenges, and roles in the continuum of care. Understanding these settings is essential for clinicians to ensure timely, coordinated, and effective support.

## 1. Inpatient Palliative Care

Inpatient palliative care is delivered to patients admitted to hospitals, either as part of a **consult service** or within a **dedicated palliative care unit (PCU)**.

### A. Inpatient Consultation Services

- Often embedded in tertiary and community hospitals
- Provided by interdisciplinary teams: physicians, nurses, social workers, chaplains
- Consulted for:
  - Refractory symptom management (e.g., pain, dyspnea, delirium)
  - Goals of care discussions
  - End-of-life planning and hospice transitions
  - Family conflict or high-stakes decision-making

**Advantages:**

- Rapid access to expert care for acutely ill patients
- Support for overwhelmed primary teams
- Improved communication between specialties

**Limitations:**

- Short-term focus
- May lack follow-up after discharge without outpatient linkage

### B. Inpatient Palliative Care Units (PCUs)

- Dedicated hospital units for complex symptom control, psychosocial crises, or end-of-life care
- Often serve patients who are not appropriate for ICU but require intensive comfort measures
- Emphasize family presence, communication, and dignity

**Outcomes:**

- High patient and family satisfaction
- Fewer invasive procedures at end of life
- Decreased ICU utilization in terminal cases

## 2. Outpatient Palliative Care

Outpatient palliative care provides longitudinal support for patients not currently hospitalized. It is increasingly recognized as a **proactive model** ideal for early integration.

### A. Structure

- May be stand-alone clinics or embedded in cancer centers, heart failure programs, or primary care settings
- Appointments include:
  - Symptom assessment and titration of treatments
  - Advance care planning and prognostic discussions
  - Coordination with other specialties and social services

### B. Indications

- Patients with stable but progressive serious illness
- Ongoing needs for symptom management
- Need for repeated conversations about prognosis, goals, or future planning

**Advantages:**

- Continuity over time
- Builds trusting relationships
- Reduces unnecessary emergency visits and hospitalizations
- Supports early palliative intervention alongside disease-modifying therapies

**Challenges:**

- Requires patient ability to travel or use telehealth
- May be limited by staffing or space in busy institutions

### C. Evidence of Benefit

Studies (e.g., Temel et al., 2010) show that outpatient palliative care:

- Improves quality of life and mood
- Increases goal-concordant care
- May improve survival in certain populations (e.g., advanced lung cancer)

## 3. Home-Based Palliative Care

Home-based palliative care brings services directly to patients who are homebound, prefer to remain at home, or are at the end of life.

### A. Who Provides Home-Based Care?

- Home health agencies with palliative-trained clinicians
- Specialty palliative care teams doing home visits
- Hospice providers (if the patient qualifies)
- Virtual support through telepalliative platforms

### B. Services Offered

- Assessment and management of symptoms
- Medication management and caregiver education
- Psychosocial support and spiritual counseling
- Coordination with hospice when appropriate

**Advantages:**

- Allows care in a familiar, less stressful environment
- Empowers family caregivers with support and tools
- Reduces ED visits and hospital readmissions
- Promotes peaceful, dignified dying at home for appropriate patients

**Challenges:**

- Limited provider availability in rural or low-resource areas
- Requires coordination of nursing, pharmacy, equipment delivery
- May need frequent in-person or virtual check-ins during clinical changes

|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Setting**         | Hospital (ward, ICU, PCU)                     | Clinic or ambulatory specialty setting         | Patient’s home                                 |
| **Focus**           | Acute issues, high symptom burden             | Longitudinal care, early integration           | End-of-life or homebound support                |
| **Team Composition**| Full interdisciplinary team                   | May be smaller teams or co-located with clinics| Varies; may include virtual or visiting staff   |
| **Continuity**      | Episodic, tied to admission                   | High continuity over time                      | High continuity; supports peaceful dying        |
| **Resource Needs**  | High infrastructure, staff availability       | Space, outpatient scheduling                   | Transport, tech support, nursing availability   |
| **Ideal For**       | Uncontrolled symptoms, crisis, complex ethics | Prognostic discussions, stable symptoms        | Bedbound or end-stage patients at home          |

## Integration Across Settings

Palliative care is most effective when **fluidly integrated** across settings:

- A hospitalized patient may be referred to **inpatient palliative care**, discharged to **outpatient follow-up**, and eventually transitioned to **home-based or hospice care**.
- Communication between teams and systems (via EMRs, case managers, handoff protocols) is critical to preserve continuity.
- Transitions must be handled sensitively, ensuring no disruption in support.

## Conclusion

Inpatient, outpatient, and home-based palliative care models serve different—but equally vital—roles in supporting patients with serious illness. Whether addressing a crisis in the hospital, guiding long-term planning in the clinic, or providing dignity at home, each setting contributes to a seamless and person-centered continuum of care. Effective palliative systems ensure that patients receive the right level of care, in the right place, at the right time.
