Replace the current "DiseaseProgressTracker" component in the CDU (Cancer Day Unit) module with a new interactive and AI-guided **Treatment Plan Selector** segment tailored for oncologists.

üß† CONTEXT:
The current component (`DiseaseProgressTracker`) is a static dashboard that summarizes treatment response using mock data. We no longer need this. Instead, we want to provide oncologists with a **decision support UI** that helps them choose the most suitable treatment options for any cancer type, stage, and patient profile.

üìÅ FILE TO UPDATE:
`client/src/modules/cdu/CDUModule.tsx`

üöÄ OBJECTIVE:
Completely **remove** the `DiseaseProgressTracker` segment and **replace it with a new tab** called:
üß¨ Treatment Plan Selector

Edit
This new segment should provide a full-featured, form-driven UI that allows oncologists to select from dropdowns and filters based on clinical oncology variables and receive smart treatment suggestions.

‚úÖ FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:

1. **Dropdown Filters:**
   - Cancer Type (e.g., Breast, Colon, Lung, SCLC, AML, Gastric, etc.)
   - Stage (0, I, II, III, IV + Substages)
   - Histology / Subtype (e.g., Ductal, Lobular, Mucinous)
   - IHC Markers (e.g., ER, PR, HER2, PD-L1, MSI, ALK, EGFR)
   - Molecular Profile (e.g., KRAS, BRAF, NTRK, etc.)
   - Treatment Intent (Curative / Palliative)
   - Line of Treatment (1st Line, 2nd Line, Adjuvant, Maintenance, etc.)
   - Previous Treatments (multi-select dropdown with smart logic)
   - Reason for Changing Treatment (Progression, Intolerance, Resistance)

2. **Dynamic Output Panel:**
   After user selects all relevant inputs, display a **treatment recommendation panel** that shows:
   - Suggested Protocol(s)
   - Intent (Curative / Palliative)
   - Supporting Guidelines (e.g., NCCN v2025, ESMO, ASCO)
   - Drug list with dosing logic placeholders
   - Alerts for clinical trials or resistance markers

3. **Optional Buttons:**
   - View Drug Details (opens side panel or tooltip)
   - Save Treatment Plan (if applicable)
   - Print / Export PDF

üõë TO REMOVE:
- Completely delete the `DiseaseProgressTracker` component and its imports.
- Remove any mock data arrays, metrics cards, or timeline code related to the tracker.

üìê DESIGN GUIDANCE:
- Use Tailwind CSS (matching existing CDU layout)
- Use ShadCN UI components if available (Select, Tabs, Cards, Tooltip)
- Use icons from Lucide React (for cancer site, staging, biomarkers, etc.)
- Support dark mode
- Maintain responsive layout with 2-column input + output grid on large screens

üìä DATA:
For now, use mock data and dropdown options defined in constants or arrays. Do **not** use any patient data. This is purely for decision simulation.

üß† FUTURE ENHANCEMENT NOTE:
We may later integrate this with a clinical decision support engine or Supabase backend to pull real guideline data and match against input criteria.

üìå FINAL GOAL:
Provide oncologists with a **powerful and intuitive interface** to simulate and explore treatment options for various cancer types and patient profiles **within the CDU module** under the new tab titled ‚ÄúTreatment Plan Selector.‚Äù
