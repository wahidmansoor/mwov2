ðŸ”§ SYSTEM UPGRADE REQUEST FOR ONCOLOGY GUIDANCE APP ðŸ”§

You are tasked with upgrading the entire app into a fully structured, professional-grade clinical guidance platform (not EHR), focused on oncology and palliative care.

Follow these upgrade instructions carefully and apply changes globally across **all modules and all segments** of the app.

---

âœ… 1. **Cross-Platform Accessibility**
- Ensure full responsive layout for **desktop, mobile, and tablet**.
- Use a unified layout framework (e.g., responsive Tailwind or CSS Grid) across the app.
- Add breakpoint-specific behavior to ensure smooth UX/UI on different devices.
- Enable touch-friendly UI for mobile/tablet.

---

âœ… 2. **Database Table Enforcement**
- Every **section of every module** must have at least **one dedicated table** in the Replit Database.
- If any section lacks a database table, **create one** with relevant keys and migrate any existing static/mock data into it.
- Structure tables using key-value pairs and JSON objects compatible with Replit's database.
- Maintain consistent naming conventions using kebab-case or snake_case.

---

âœ… 3. **Dynamic Content Extendability**
- App structure should support dynamic row-based extension.
- Any future addition to a module or section should be easily handled by **just adding a new row** to the respective table.
- Ensure UI auto-renders added content without requiring layout edits.

---

âœ… 4. **Documentation System (User/Admin Manuals)**
- ðŸ”’ **Admin Manual**
  - Create a detailed Markdown (`admin_manual.md`) guide for full app management, including:
    - How to add/edit data via DB
    - Template import/export
    - User management
    - App reset/recovery

- ðŸ“˜ **User Manual**
  - Build an app-accessible interactive guide or help section.
  - Explain how to use each module
  - Add searchable FAQ and instructions.

---

âœ… 5. **AI-Compatible Template Export + JSON Parser Support**
- Create a **standardized export template file** (`template_export.md` or `.json`) that:
  - Is ready to be used by any AI model for content generation or modification
  - Can extract relevant medical content from **JSON** parsed from PDFs (e.g., NCCN, ESMO, ASCO)
  - Breaks content down into logical categories for the correct module/section
  - Includes tags or metadata to direct which section of the app the data belongs to (e.g., "Module: OPD", "Section: Biomarkers")

---

âœ… 6. **Security: Auto Logoff Feature**
- Implement **auto-logout** or session expiration logic:
  - After **15 minutes of inactivity**, log the user out securely
  - Clear session data and return to login screen
  - Alert user with a countdown at 13 minutes for activity resumption

---

ðŸ“Œ FINAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- DO NOT include any EHR components
- Do NOT use Supabase, Firebase, or PostgreSQL. Stick to **Replit Database only**
- Avoid dummy profiles. Use **actual data structure** templates and default real-world tags.
- Optimize for **low-latency** and **scalability**
- Place new files (manuals, templates) in `/docs` or `/system` folder
