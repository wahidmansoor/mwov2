# Update Summary for Oncology Protocols Table

## üìÅ File: `cd_protocols` (Supabase Table)
This update introduces **new fields and information** into the existing chemotherapy protocols database table, based on new insights extracted from the **NCCN Breast Cancer Guidelines (Version 4.2025)**.

---

## üß† Why This Update?

The current table contains general information about chemotherapy regimens (like drugs, doses, and eligibility). However, the NCCN guidelines provide **more detailed, evidence-based recommendations** that can make the app smarter, safer, and more aligned with clinical standards.

This update **adds more fields** to each protocol entry, making them easier to filter, more precise for decision-making, and future-proof.

## ‚úÖ New Information to Be Added

| Field Name              | What It Means                                                                 | Why It's Important                                              |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `biomarker_requirements` | Lists required biomarkers (e.g., HER2, ER, BRCA) for using the protocol     | Ensures the protocol matches a patient's molecular profile      |
| `line_of_therapy`       | States whether it's 1st-line, 2nd-line, adjuvant, etc.                      | Helps clinicians know where in treatment this applies           |
| `treatment_setting`     | Defines if the protocol is for early-stage, metastatic, etc.               | Clarifies patient group it‚Äôs designed for                       |
| `nccn_category`         | Strength of recommendation (e.g., Category 1, 2A)                           | Reflects how strong the guideline support is                    |
| `toxicity_monitoring`   | Lists risks (e.g., neuropathy) + how to monitor (e.g., CBC, ECHO)           | Improves safety by reminding what to check                      |
| `contraindications`     | Conditions where this protocol should NOT be used                          | Avoids harm to high-risk patients                               |
| `alternate_options`     | Drug substitutions or safer alternatives                                   | Offers flexible treatment choices                               |

## üìå Example Before vs After

### üü• Before:
- Protocol Name: AC-T
- Tumor Group: Breast
- Summary: General description
- Drugs: Adriamycin + Cyclophosphamide + Paclitaxel

### üü© After:
- Adds: `treatment_setting = Early-stage`
- Adds: `line_of_therapy = Adjuvant`
- Adds: `biomarker_requirements = HER2 Negative`
- Adds: `nccn_category = 1`
- Adds: Toxicities and monitoring tools
- Adds: Contraindications like low LVEF
- Adds: Drug substitutes like docetaxel

## üí° In Simple Terms

We are upgrading our database to:
- Include **exact rules** about which patients should get which treatment
- Add **warnings and side effects** per drug
- Add **flexibility** so doctors can choose alternatives when needed
- Make it smarter, safer, and more useful in real life

## üõ† What's Next?

This is just the first enhanced entry (`AC-T`). More protocols will be processed similarly from the PDF and saved in a structured format for easy updates in Supabase or CSV.
