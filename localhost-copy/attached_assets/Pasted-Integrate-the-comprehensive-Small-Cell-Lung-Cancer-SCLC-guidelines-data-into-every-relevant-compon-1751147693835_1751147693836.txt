Integrate the comprehensive Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) guidelines data into every relevant component of the OncoVista application. The JSON contains detailed NCCN guidelines v4.2025 with staging, treatment protocols, drug dosages, recommendations, and surveillance schedules.
JSON Data Structure Overview
The provided JSON contains:

Guideline Metadata: Title, version (4.2025), date, copyright
Sections: Overview, Diagnosis, Evaluation, Staging Tables, Treatment, Surveillance
Subsections: Screening, Pathology, Surgical Resection, Systemic Therapy, etc.
Recommendations: 30+ clinical recommendations with categories, dosages, schedules
Staging Tables: AJCC TNM definitions, prognostic groups
Treatment Protocols: Detailed drug regimens with exact dosages and schedules

Integration Requirements
1. Protocol Management System

Create SCLC Protocol Cards: Extract all treatment recommendations (rec-1 through rec-30) and display them as searchable protocol cards
Staging Integration: Implement the AJCC staging tables as interactive components
Treatment Pathways: Create decision trees based on limited vs extensive stage disease
Drug Dosage Calculator: Build calculators for carboplatin AUC, cisplatin dosing, etoposide schedules

2. Dashboard Enhancements

SCLC Quick Access Panel: Add dedicated SCLC section to main dashboard
Stage-Specific Widgets: Show different treatment options based on disease stage
Recent Guidelines Badge: Highlight this as latest v4.2025 guidelines
Progress Tracking: Patient journey tracking through SCLC treatment phases

3. Search and Navigation

Enhanced Search: Make all SCLC content searchable by keywords (cisplatin, etoposide, durvalumab, etc.)
Intelligent Filtering: Filter by stage (limited/extensive), treatment type (surgery/chemo/radiation)
Cross-References: Link related sections (e.g., staging → treatment → surveillance)
Quick Jump Navigation: Sidebar shortcuts to key SCLC sections

4. Clinical Calculators Integration

Carboplatin AUC Calculator: Implement Calvert formula with guidelines dosing
Performance Status Assessment: Integrate PS scoring relevant to SCLC prognosis
Staging Calculator: Input TNM parameters → output stage and treatment recommendations
Surveillance Schedule Generator: Based on stage and treatment completion

5. AI Agent Enhancement

SCLC-Specific Prompts: Train AI responses using the guidelines data
Treatment Recommendation Engine: AI suggests protocols based on patient parameters
Drug Interaction Checker: Cross-reference with SCLC medications
Guidelines Q&A: Answer specific questions about SCLC protocols

6. Handbook Integration

SCLC Handbook Section: Convert JSON sections into formatted handbook entries
Interactive Tables: Make staging tables sortable and filterable
Printable Protocols: Generate PDF summaries of treatment plans
Bookmark System: Save frequently accessed SCLC protocols

7. Data Structure Implementation
Database Schema Updates (Supabase)
sql-- Add SCLC-specific tables
CREATE TABLE sclc_guidelines (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  version VARCHAR(10),
  section_id VARCHAR(50),
  title TEXT,
  content JSONB,
  recommendations JSONB,
  metadata JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE sclc_protocols (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  recommendation_id VARCHAR(20),
  category VARCHAR(10),
  agent_names TEXT[],
  dosages JSONB,
  schedule TEXT,
  stage VARCHAR(20),
  metadata JSONB
);
React Components to Create/Update

SCLCProtocolCard.tsx - Display individual protocols
SCLCStagingTable.tsx - Interactive staging tables
SCLCTreatmentPathway.tsx - Decision tree component
SCLCDrugCalculator.tsx - Dosage calculations
SCLCSurveillanceSchedule.tsx - Follow-up scheduling
SCLCGuidanceWizard.tsx - Step-by-step treatment guidance

8. User Experience Enhancements

Smart Suggestions: Show relevant SCLC protocols based on current page
Treatment Timeline: Visual timeline of SCLC treatment phases
Drug Reference Cards: Quick-access cards for common SCLC medications
Clinical Decision Support: Guided workflows for complex cases

9. API Endpoints to Implement
typescript// SCLC-specific API routes
GET /api/sclc/guidelines/:section
GET /api/sclc/protocols/stage/:stage
GET /api/sclc/recommendations/:category
POST /api/sclc/calculate-dosage
GET /api/sclc/surveillance-schedule
POST /api/sclc/treatment-plan
10. Content Organization Strategy

Module Structure: Create dedicated /modules/sclc/ directory
Staged Implementation: Limited stage → Extensive stage → Surveillance
Cross-Module Integration: Link SCLC content with existing calculators and tools
Version Control: Track guideline updates and changes

Implementation Instructions for Replit

Parse the JSON completely - Extract every piece of data including nested recommendations, dosages, schedules, and metadata
Create comprehensive database seeding - Populate Supabase with structured SCLC data
Build modular components - Each recommendation should be a reusable component
Implement smart search - Index all SCLC content for instant retrieval
Add visual elements - Use charts for staging, timelines for treatment
Ensure mobile responsiveness - All SCLC features must work on tablets/phones
Include error handling - Graceful fallbacks for missing data
Add comprehensive testing - Unit tests for all SCLC calculations and components

Success Criteria

All 30+ recommendations are accessible and searchable
Staging tables are interactive and user-friendly
Drug calculations are accurate and validated
Treatment pathways guide users logically
AI agent can answer SCLC-specific questions
Content is properly categorized and cross-linked
Mobile experience is optimized
Performance remains fast with added content

Priority Order

Core SCLC protocol display and search
Staging table integration
Drug dosage calculators
AI agent enhancement with SCLC knowledge
Surveillance scheduling tools
Advanced decision support features

Please implement this comprehensively, ensuring that every piece of information in the JSON becomes a useful, accessible feature within the OncoVista application. Focus on creating an intuitive user experience that helps oncologists quickly find and apply the most current SCLC guidelines in their clinical practice.
