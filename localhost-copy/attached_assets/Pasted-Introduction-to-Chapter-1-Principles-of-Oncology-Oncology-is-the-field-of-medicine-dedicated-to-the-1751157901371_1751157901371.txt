Introduction to Chapter 1: Principles of Oncology
Oncology is the field of medicine dedicated to the study, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer—a disease that remains a leading cause of death globally. A solid understanding of the biological principles underlying cancer is essential for effective clinical care, research, and the development of new therapies. This chapter introduces the foundational concepts of oncology, including cancer biology, carcinogenesis, and tumor immunology, which collectively provide the framework for more advanced clinical topics discussed in later chapters.

Cancer arises from normal cells that acquire the ability to grow uncontrollably, evade regulatory signals, and ultimately invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to distant organs. This transformation results from a series of molecular and cellular alterations, often involving both genetic mutations and epigenetic changes. These processes are influenced by inherited factors, environmental exposures, and lifestyle behaviors.

A central framework in understanding cancer biology is the concept of the hallmarks of cancer, which describes the key capabilities acquired during tumor development. These include sustained proliferative signaling, resistance to cell death, evasion of growth suppressors, replicative immortality, angiogenesis, and the ability to invade and metastasize. Later additions to this framework include altered cellular metabolism and immune evasion. These hallmarks help clinicians and researchers understand how tumors behave and how they might be therapeutically targeted.

The molecular basis of cancer involves activation of oncogenes—genes that promote cell growth—and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, which normally inhibit proliferation or promote repair and apoptosis. Mutations may occur spontaneously or as a result of carcinogenic exposures. Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, also play a role in silencing tumor suppressor genes without altering the underlying DNA sequence.

Beyond the tumor cells themselves, the tumor microenvironment (TME)—which includes stromal cells, immune cells, blood vessels, and extracellular matrix—plays a critical role in supporting tumor growth, facilitating immune evasion, and influencing therapeutic response. Interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment are increasingly recognized as key targets for therapy.

Carcinogenesis, or the development of cancer, is a multistep process influenced by both genetic predisposition and external risk factors. These include tobacco use, alcohol, poor diet, infections (e.g., HPV, HBV, H. pylori), radiation, and occupational exposures. Understanding these factors informs strategies for prevention, screening, and risk assessment.

A growing area of interest is tumor immunology, which examines how the immune system interacts with cancer. The concept of immune surveillance refers to the immune system’s ability to detect and eliminate nascent tumor cells. However, tumors can evade immune detection through a variety of mechanisms, such as downregulation of antigen presentation and expression of immune checkpoint molecules. These insights have led to the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors, which restore T-cell activity against cancer, and are now standard treatments in several malignancies.

In summary, the principles outlined in this chapter form the biological and conceptual foundation for understanding cancer pathophysiology and guide the rationale behind diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Mastery of these core concepts is essential for clinicians and students engaging in modern oncology practice.
