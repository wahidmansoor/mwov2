Upgrade the existing Oncology Education Module to a dynamic, evidence-based, AI-powered learning platform that enables oncologists and palliative care teams at all levels to:
- Master clinical concepts in oncology
- Prepare for specialization exams
- Train with guideline-backed interactive case scenarios
- Track real learning performance  
‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a guidance-only app. It must not include any EHR functionalities, login profiles, or dummy patients.**

## üîç Primary Audit-Based Weaknesses to Fix
- Static content and placeholder data
- No structured clinical cases or decision trees
- No database integration for educational content
- Lack of analytics, feedback, and performance monitoring

---

## üîÅ Upgrade Strategy

### 1. üéì Educational Engine: Guideline-Driven Learning
Implement a structured logic system using real oncology data from:

- **NCCN Guidelines**
- **ASCO & ESMO** Educational Series
- **PubMed**, **Cochrane Reviews**, and **ClinicalTrials.gov**
- Real world guideline PDFs provided locally or fetched remotely

**No dummy profiles. All learning logic must be 100% grounded in current clinical data and literature.**

### 2. üß† Intelligent Modules to Implement

#### A. Case Simulation System
- Adaptive branching scenarios with feedback
- Staging decisions, drug choices, treatment plans
- Immediate comparison with NCCN/ESMO logic
- Audit-based step scoring per decision made

#### B. Smart Question Bank
- MCQs, EMQs, and Visual Questions
- Answers and rationale directly pulled from guidelines
- Tagging by topic, organ system, level, and exam standard

#### C. AI Tutor Assistant
- Allow natural language queries like:
  - ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the current 1st line protocol for KRAS wild-type colorectal cancer?‚Äù
- Use guideline and citation-based NLP responses only (no hallucinations)
- Include citations (e.g., NCCN V3.2025, ASCO J Clin Oncol 2024)

#### D. Performance Tracker
- Track topic mastery, common mistakes, and improvement
- Trend visualizations per subspecialty and organ site
- Exportable reports (PDF, CSV) for learning audits

### 3. üß© Replit Database Schema

Use `@replit/database` for data storage instead of Supabase or PostgreSQL.

```js
// Schema example stored as key-value entries in Replit DB

"topics": [
  {
    "id": "topic1",
    "title": "Breast Cancer Staging",
    "category": "Staging",
    "guideline_reference": "NCCN V3.2025",
    "difficulty": "Intermediate"
  }
]

"scenarios": [
  {
    "id": "scenario1",
    "title": "HER2+ Breast Cancer Initial Management",
    "steps": ["Assess HER2 status", "Check cardiac function", "Start trastuzumab"],
    "guideline_ref": "ASCO 2024"
  }
]

"questions": [
  {
    "id": "q1",
    "topic_id": "topic1",
    "question": "What is the T2 staging criteria for breast cancer?",
    "options": ["<2cm", "2-5cm", "5-7cm", ">7cm"],
    "correct_answer": "2-5cm",
    "rationale": "Based on AJCC/NCCN staging guidelines",
    "sources": ["NCCN Breast 2025"]
  }
]
```

### 4. üîß Technical Implementation

#### Frontend
- Tabbed layout for: Flashcards | Scenarios | QBank | Analytics
- Markdown rendering with citation tooltips
- Charts for performance tracking (e.g., Chart.js)
- Mobile-optimized with light/dark themes

#### Backend
- Use Replit‚Äôs `@replit/database` for persistent data
- Create helper functions to `get`, `set`, `update`, and `delete` entries
- Implement AI search with OpenRouter (if available)

---

### 5. ‚úÖ Outcome
A full academic-grade educational platform that:
- Uses real oncology literature only
- Educates at all levels (residents to consultants)
- Supports exam prep for MRCP, ESMO, FRCR, etc.
- Offers smart guidance with no dummy data or login
