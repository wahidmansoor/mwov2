# ü©∫ Palliative Care Module Enhancement Prompt

## üîç Project Overview
Upgrade the existing **Palliative Care Module** into a robust, interactive, and evidence-based clinical guidance tool for oncologists and palliative care teams. This system is *not* an EHR and must avoid storing patient-identifying data. It serves as a decision-support and symptom-guidance interface only.

---

## üìä Audit Summary
Based on the current audits:

- **Advance Directives**: Static informational content with no dynamic tracking or summaries.
- **Family Support**: Cards and text with no data-driven caregiver tracking or assessments.
- **Pain Management**: Non-functional opioid calculator; lacks interactivity and personalization.
- **Psychosocial Care**: Displays static tools (e.g., PHQ-2); no dynamic input or referral tracking.
- **Symptom Control**: Only pain and nausea sliders have state; rest are static.

## üéØ Key Objectives

### üß± 1. Database Design (Non-EHR, Session-Scoped)
Design database tables for temporary session-linked data without patient identifiers.

#### Core Tables
```sql
-- Non-identifiable session-based context
session_logs (id, session_id, clinician_id, date, notes)

-- Symptom Assessment
symptom_scores (id, session_id, date, symptom, score)
symptom_protocols (id, symptom, severity_level, recommendations_json)

-- Pain Management
pain_assessments (id, session_id, pain_type, location, scale, notes)
opioid_conversions (id, from_med, to_med, factor, route_from, route_to)
breakthrough_pain (id, session_id, timestamp, med_given, response_rating)

-- Advance Directives
goals_of_care (id, session_id, code_status, preferences, structured_notes)

-- Family Support
caregiver_scores (id, session_id, scale_used, score, needs_flagged)
resource_links (id, title, category, url, last_reviewed)

-- Psychosocial Support
psychosocial_screening (id, session_id, phq9_score, gad7_score, spiritual_scale, follow_up_needed)
referral_tracking (id, session_id, referral_type, outcome, provider, follow_up_date)
```

### üß† 2. Functional Enhancements

#### A. Symptom Control
- Enable 0‚Äì10 sliders for **all** symptoms (fatigue, dyspnea, sleep, appetite, etc.)
- Use trend graphs (e.g. Recharts) for tracking symptom score changes
- Protocol auto-suggestions by symptom severity
- Option to export full symptom logs to PDF/CSV

#### B. Pain Management
- Add a fully functional opioid converter with:
  - Equianalgesic logic
  - Route-switch calculations
  - Age/renal/hepatic adjustments
- Visual pain ladder with dynamic recommendations
- Track response to interventions
- Monitor and display common side effects

#### C. Advance Directives
- Interactive goals of care wizard
- Template-based code status options
- Printable summaries (PDF format)
- Track preferences and decision-maker information without storing identifiers

#### D. Family Support
- Zarit Burden Interview integration (scored)
- Meeting note templates and caregiver logs
- Educational content (PDFs, videos)
- Simple caregiver chart with flagged needs

#### E. Psychosocial Care
- Integrate PHQ-9, GAD-7, and spiritual care tools with scoring logic
- Track referrals and their status
- Add culturally responsive coping and support options
- Create intervention logs for sessions

---

### üõ†Ô∏è 3. Technical Implementation

#### Frontend (React)
- All forms interactive and validated
- Recharts for visual analytics
- Accessible components (ARIA + keyboard nav)
- Print/export buttons for every section
- Role-based UI access (doctor, nurse, spiritual care, etc.)

#### Backend
- REST API for all operations
- PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexible field storage
- Session-level audit logging
- No patient ID stored ‚Äî pseudonymized session references only

---

### üìö 4. Content & Reference Standards
- NCCN, ASCO, WHO guidelines for pain, symptom, palliative care
- Cochrane reviews for evidence-level tagging
- Validated tools (e.g., PPS, ESAS, Karnofsky, PHQ-9, GAD-7)
- NIH/NCI content for patient and caregiver education

---

### ‚úÖ Outcomes & KPIs
- 90%+ feature usage by palliative care team
- <2s load time for assessments
- 100% audit traceability of decision logic
- Weekly export of quality metrics (pain control, symptom flags)
- 0% PHI (protected health info) exposure ‚Äî full EHR separation maintained

> **Note**: This system is strictly a *guidance assistant*. No integration with hospital records, no patient-identifiable information, and no billing/scheduling functionality is permitted.
