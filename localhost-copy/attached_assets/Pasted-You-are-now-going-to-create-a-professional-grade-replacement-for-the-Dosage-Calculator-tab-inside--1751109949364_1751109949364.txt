You are now going to create a professional-grade replacement for the "Dosage Calculator" tab inside the CDU Module of the OncoVista app.

**Goal**: Completely remove the "Dosage Calculator" tab and replace it with a new tab titled **"Medications"**. This tab should display a comprehensive, searchable, and filterable interface that showcases **all oncology medications ever used in cancer treatment**, as provided in the supplied dataset.

üü£ **Frontend UI Requirements:**

1. **New Tab**: Label it `Medications`, placed between "Treatment Protocols" and "Toxicity Management".
2. **Search Bar**: Enable searching by drug name, brand name, or indication.
3. **Filter Dropdowns**:
   - Classification (e.g. SERD, Checkpoint Inhibitor, etc.)
   - Route (e.g. Oral, IV, Subcutaneous)
   - Cancer Type (dynamic list extracted from all indications)
4. **Medication Card or Table View**:
   - Drug name + brand name
   - Classification
   - Indications (cancer types)
   - Standard dose
   - Mechanism of action
   - Icons or badges for: chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, orphan drug
   - Optional: ‚ÄúView Details‚Äù button expands full info (e.g. side effects, monitoring, pharmacokinetics)
5. **Dark Mode Support**, Tailwind CSS or ShadCN UI components.
6. **Mobile Responsive** layout.

üü¢ **Backend/Database Requirements:**

1. Create a new table named `oncology_medications` (if using Supabase, this table already exists).
2. Accept and structure the provided JSON data into the following fields:
   - `id`, `name`, `brand_names`, `classification`, `mechanism`, `administration`, `dosing`, `indications`, `side_effects`, `monitoring`, `interactions`, `summary`, `black_box_warning`, `pharmacokinetics`, `special_considerations`, `contraindications`, `routine_monitoring`, `pre_treatment_tests`, `reference_sources`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
3. Ensure that nested arrays (e.g. side effects, indications) are preserved in readable JSON columns or transformed into related relational tables if needed.
4. Expose an endpoint (or Supabase API query) to fetch the data into the frontend using `fetch()` or `axios`.

üí° **Notes:**
- Completely delete the old **Dosage Calculator** files and components.
- This module should match the visual and UX quality of the current Treatment Protocols section.
- Must support fast loading and user interaction (pagination optional).
- Tooltips, icons, or badges should enhance understanding of special drug attributes (e.g. targeted, chemo, orphan).
