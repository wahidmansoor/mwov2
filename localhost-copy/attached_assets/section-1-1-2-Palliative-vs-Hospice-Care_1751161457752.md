# 1.1.2 Palliative vs. Hospice Care

## Introduction

While often used interchangeably in public and clinical discourse, **palliative care** and **hospice care** are distinct yet overlapping models of care that share a common philosophy: the prioritization of comfort, dignity, and quality of life for individuals living with serious illness. Understanding the similarities and differences between these two approaches is essential for clinicians, patients, and families to make timely, informed decisions that align with individual values and goals of care.

This section outlines the key features of both palliative and hospice care, clarifies misconceptions, discusses eligibility and settings, and provides guidance for clinical application and communication.

## Common Ground

Both palliative and hospice care:

- Emphasize **quality of life**, symptom control, and relief of suffering
- Utilize **interdisciplinary teams** (physicians, nurses, social workers, chaplains, etc.)
- Address **psychosocial, emotional, and spiritual needs** of patients and families
- Support **shared decision-making**, advance care planning, and caregiver involvement
- Can be delivered across various **care settings**, including hospitals, homes, and long-term care facilities

They are rooted in the same ethical principles—respect for autonomy, beneficence, and nonmaleficence—and aim to deliver person-centered, holistic care.

## Key Differences Between Palliative and Hospice Care

| **Aspect**                     | **Palliative Care**                                                   | **Hospice Care**                                                   |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Timing**                    | At any stage of a serious illness                                      | Generally in the final 6 months of life                             |
| **Concurrent Treatment**      | Can be provided **with curative or life-prolonging treatments**       | Typically focuses on **comfort only**, after curative intent ends   |
| **Eligibility Criteria**      | Based on **need**, not prognosis                                       | Requires a **prognosis of ≤6 months** and **no curative intent**    |
| **Care Goals**                | Relief of symptoms, support during illness, enhancement of quality     | End-of-life comfort care and support for peaceful dying             |
| **Coverage (US context)**     | Variable; billed like other medical services (insurance, Medicare Part B) | Covered under **Medicare/Medicaid Hospice Benefit** or similar programs |
| **Settings**                  | Hospital, clinic, home, nursing facility                               | Home, inpatient hospice, SNF, hospital                              |
| **Care Focus**                | Ongoing support for both **stable and progressing illness**            | Intensive support in **terminal phase**                             |

## Clinical and System-Level Implications

- **Palliative care** is best introduced **early in the disease course**—even at diagnosis—particularly when patients begin experiencing symptoms or psychosocial distress. It **coexists** with treatments like chemotherapy, dialysis, or heart failure management.
  
- **Hospice care** is reserved for patients whose **prognosis is limited** (generally six months or fewer), and who have chosen to **forego disease-directed treatment** in favor of comfort and dignity.

Early engagement with palliative services often results in smoother transitions to hospice when appropriate.

## Medicare Hospice Benefit (U.S.)

Eligibility for hospice under the Medicare benefit includes:

- A **certified prognosis** of ≤6 months if the disease runs its usual course
- Election of **comfort-focused care only** (no life-prolonging treatments for the terminal diagnosis)
- Enrolled patients receive comprehensive support including:
  - Medical care
  - Nursing services
  - Medications related to the terminal illness
  - Durable medical equipment (e.g., hospital beds)
  - Chaplaincy and social work
  - Grief and bereavement support for the family (up to 13 months)

## Myths and Misconceptions

| **Misconception**                             | **Clarification**                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| “Palliative care is only for dying patients”  | Palliative care can and should be used early in illness, even during active treatment. |
| “Hospice means giving up”                     | Hospice is about **living well until the end**, not surrendering to illness.      |
| “You must stop all treatments to receive palliative care” | Only hospice typically requires stopping curative intent; palliative care does not. |
| “Hospice is a place”                          | Hospice is a **model of care**, not a physical location—it can be provided anywhere. |

These misunderstandings often delay referrals and reduce the potential benefit patients and families could derive from these services.

## When to Refer

### Palliative Care Referral Triggers
- Newly diagnosed serious illness
- Poorly controlled symptoms (e.g., pain, dyspnea, fatigue)
- Emotional or spiritual distress
- Recurrent hospitalizations
- Complex communication needs
- Declining functional status

### Hospice Referral Triggers
- Frequent hospital admissions or ED visits
- Rapid clinical decline (weight loss, functional loss)
- Refractory symptoms despite standard treatment
- Patient goals align with comfort rather than cure
- Progressive terminal disease with no active treatment options remaining

## Integrating the Two

Palliative care **often leads to hospice** when the patient’s disease progresses and goals shift fully toward comfort. In many systems, palliative teams **facilitate hospice transitions**, ensuring continuity and a patient-centered approach throughout the disease trajectory.

Some countries use the term “**generalist palliative care**” (provided by primary teams) and “**specialist palliative care**” (led by dedicated palliative professionals), with hospice falling under the umbrella of specialty care for the dying phase.

---

## Global Considerations

- In **low-resource settings**, palliative care may be provided only at the end of life and may be termed “hospice,” blurring distinctions seen in higher-resource countries.
- Some countries lack formal hospice programs but integrate palliative principles in oncology, infectious disease, geriatrics, and primary care.
- Expanding both **access** and **clarity** around these services is a public health priority, especially as global aging and chronic illness burdens increase.

## Conclusion

While palliative and hospice care share a philosophical foundation rooted in dignity and comfort, they differ in timing, treatment goals, eligibility, and structure. All hospice is palliative, but not all palliative care is hospice. A clear understanding of both models ensures that patients receive the right type of support at the right time. Clinicians should advocate for earlier integration of palliative care, while also recognizing when a timely hospice transition can best serve the patient and family.
