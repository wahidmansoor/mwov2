# 1.2.3 Interaction of Radiation with Matter

## Introduction

The therapeutic effects of radiation depend on how energy from ionizing radiation is transferred to biological tissues. These interactions initiate molecular damage, particularly to DNA, which underpins the efficacy of radiation therapy in cancer treatment. Understanding the physical mechanisms of energy deposition—also known as radiation interactions with matter—is essential for selecting appropriate modalities, predicting tissue response, and designing effective treatment plans.

Radiation interacts differently with tissue depending on its type (photon vs. particle), energy, and the atomic composition of the medium. These interactions occur at the atomic and subatomic levels and can be classified into several dominant mechanisms.

## 1. Photon Interactions with Matter

Photons (X-rays and gamma rays) are uncharged, massless particles. In therapeutic energy ranges (100 keV to >10 MeV), they primarily interact with tissue through three processes:

### 1.1 Photoelectric Effect

- **Mechanism**: A photon transfers all its energy to a tightly bound inner-shell electron, ejecting it from the atom.
- **Occurs at**: Low photon energies (<30 keV)
- **Dependence**: Strongly dependent on atomic number (Z³); more likely in high-Z materials (e.g., bone, contrast agents)

**Clinical relevance**:
- Dominates in diagnostic imaging (e.g., mammography)
- Less significant in megavoltage therapeutic beams
- Important in brachytherapy or kilovoltage treatments for skin cancers

### 1.2 Compton Scattering

- **Mechanism**: A photon collides with a loosely bound outer-shell electron, transferring part of its energy and scattering both the photon and electron.
- **Occurs at**: Intermediate to high energies (100 keV – 10 MeV)
- **Dependence**: Weakly dependent on atomic number; proportional to electron density

**Clinical relevance**:
- **Primary interaction in megavoltage therapy** (e.g., LINAC beams)
- Produces **recoil electrons** that deposit dose locally
- Allows relatively uniform dose across tissues regardless of composition

### 1.3 Pair Production

- **Mechanism**: A high-energy photon (>1.022 MeV) interacts with the electric field of a nucleus and is converted into an **electron-positron pair**
- **Occurs at**: Energies >10 MeV
- **Dependence**: Increases with photon energy and atomic number

**Clinical relevance**:
- Minimal at standard treatment energies (<10 MV)
- Contributes at higher energies and in high-Z shielding materials
- Positrons eventually annihilate, producing two 511 keV photons — basis of PET imaging

## 2. Charged Particle Interactions

Charged particles (e.g., electrons, protons, alpha particles) deposit energy continuously along their path by direct Coulombic interactions with electrons and nuclei.

### 2.1 Electrons

- **Produced** by LINACs for superficial treatment
- Interact via:
  - **Collisional losses**: ionization and excitation of atoms
  - **Radiative losses**: bremsstrahlung radiation produced when electrons decelerate near nuclei

**Dose characteristics**:
- Sharp dose falloff at a finite depth (range depends on energy)
- Useful for skin lesions, chest wall boosts, and head & neck treatments

### 2.2 Protons

- Heavier, positively charged particles
- Exhibit the **Bragg Peak**: minimal dose along the entry path, followed by a sharp peak at a defined depth
- Beyond the peak, the dose rapidly drops to near zero

**Clinical implications**:
- Enables **highly conformal dose delivery** to deep-seated tumors
- Ideal for sparing critical structures located beyond the tumor

**Spread-out Bragg Peak (SOBP)**: A combination of proton energies to create a uniform dose across the tumor volume

## 3. High LET Particles (Carbon Ions, Alpha Particles)

### 3.1 Carbon Ions

- Heavy charged particles with **high linear energy transfer (LET)**
- Cause **dense ionization tracks** resulting in complex, often irreparable DNA damage
- RBE (Relative Biological Effectiveness) higher than for photons or protons

**Clinical relevance**:
- More effective for **radioresistant or hypoxic tumors**
- Limited to specialized centers (e.g., Germany, Japan)

### 3.2 Alpha Particles

- Massive, highly charged particles
- Extremely high LET but very short range (~40–100 µm)

**Clinical use**:
- Rare in external beam therapy
- Used in experimental **targeted alpha therapies** (e.g., radium-223 for bone metastases)

## 4. Neutron Interactions

- Neutrons are uncharged and interact via nuclear reactions
- Produce **recoil protons** and secondary particles with high LET

**Clinical considerations**:
- High RBE but poor dose conformality
- Historically used for salivary gland tumors and sarcomas
- Currently limited due to complexity and toxicity

## 5. Summary: Radiation Interaction Mechanisms

| Radiation Type | Primary Interactions              | Energy Range        | Key Features                              |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| X-rays/Gamma   | Photoelectric, Compton, Pair Prod | 30 keV – 25 MeV     | Dominant in EBRT and imaging              |
| Electrons      | Collisional, Radiative            | 6 – 20 MeV          | Superficial therapy; rapid dose falloff   |
| Protons        | Coulombic; Bragg Peak             | 70 – 250 MeV        | Precise depth control, minimal exit dose  |
| Carbon Ions    | High LET, dense ionization        | 200 – 400 MeV/nucleon | Enhanced biological effect               |
| Neutrons       | Nuclear interactions              | Variable            | High RBE, used selectively                |

## 6. Dose Distribution and Tissue Response

### Depth-Dose Profiles

- **Photons**: Gradual dose build-up with exponential falloff; deeper penetration with higher energy.
- **Electrons**: Peak near the surface with rapid drop-off; energy-dependent range.
- **Protons/Carbon Ions**: Minimal entrance dose, sharp Bragg peak at target depth.

### Clinical Implications

- **Photon therapy** is versatile but deposits exit dose.
- **Protons** and **carbon ions** enable **normal tissue sparing beyond the tumor**.
- **Electrons** are ideal for superficial targets but unsuitable for deep-seated tumors.

Understanding these profiles allows radiation oncologists to tailor dose distributions that conform tightly to the target while respecting dose constraints for organs at risk (OARs).

## 7. Secondary Effects and Radiation Scatter

- **Compton scatter** contributes to out-of-field dose and necessitates careful shielding and quality assurance.
- **Neutron contamination** may occur in high-energy photon therapy (>10 MV), albeit at low levels.

## Conclusion

The interaction of radiation with matter lies at the core of therapeutic radiology. Photons, electrons, and particles each deposit energy differently, creating a spectrum of biological effects that can be harnessed for clinical benefit. Mastery of these interactions enables radiation oncologists to select the appropriate modality, sculpt dose distributions precisely, and anticipate both efficacy and toxicity. As treatment technologies continue to evolve, the fundamental physics of energy transfer remains essential to safe, effective, and personalized cancer care.
