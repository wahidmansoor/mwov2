🛠️ TASK:
Redistribute the content from the old SCLCModule.tsx into the correct segments of the app’s main clinical modules.

🔍 CONTEXT:
The app mistakenly created a standalone "SCLC" module. But Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) is a condition that spans across existing modules, including OPD, CDU, Inpatient, and Palliative Care.

📦 SOURCE:
All relevant content is in `/client/src/modules/sclc/SCLCModule.tsx`.

🎯 GOAL:
Remove the standalone `SCLCModule.tsx` and integrate its content across the following modules:

---

📌 1. OPDModule.tsx (client/src/modules/opd/OPDModule.tsx)
➤ Distribute the following to correct tabs:
- ➕ Cancer Screening: Add a new `SCLC Screening` card
- 🔍 Diagnostic Pathways: Insert `SCLC Diagnostic Algorithm`
- 🎯 Referral Guidelines: Add specific referral criteria for extensive vs. limited-stage SCLC
- 📊 Follow-up Oncology: Add surveillance protocol from SCLC module

---

📌 2. CDUModule.tsx (client/src/modules/cdu/CDUModule.tsx)
➤ Add `SCLC Chemotherapy Protocols` to treatment protocols section
- Include limited and extensive stage protocols
- Ensure integration into dropdown/select components used for regimen loading
- Include reference to Carboplatin AUC calculator

---

📌 3. InpatientModule.tsx (client/src/modules/inpatient/InpatientModule.tsx)
➤ Add any emergency regimens or toxicity alerts from SCLC guidelines
- Particularly neutropenic fever, TLS, or rapid progression
- Integrate into Emergency Regimens and Supportive Care if applicable

---

📌 4. PalliativeCareModule.tsx (client/src/modules/palliative/PalliativeCareModule.tsx)
➤ Add content around symptom burden, poor prognosis, and end-stage planning for SCLC
- Especially for aggressive/extensive stage disease
- Add to Psychosocial Care or Terminal Support sections

---

🔁 AFTER:
1. Delete the `/sclc/` module folder
2. All SCLC data should be integrated into the above 4 modules
3. Respect Tailwind/Framer Motion/Lucide component structures

✅ DELIVERABLE:
The SCLC content should be fully incorporated and the app should have no references left to a standalone SCLC module.
