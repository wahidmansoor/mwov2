Patients who may desire future\npregnancies should be referred to fertility specialists before\nchemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy to discuss the options\nbased on patient specifics, disease stage, and biology (which\ndetermine the urgency, type, and sequence of treatment). Timing\nand duration allowed for fertility preservation, options inclusive\nof oocyte and embryo cryopreservation as well as evolving\ntechnologies, and the probability of successful pregnancies\nsubsequent to completion of breast cancer therapy are also to be\ndiscussed.\n\u2022 Although amenorrhea frequently occurs during or after\nchemotherapy, it appears that the majority of patients <35 years\nresume menses within 2 years of finishing adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\u2022 Menses and fertility are not necessarily linked. Absence of regular\nmenses, particularly if the patient is taking tamoxifen, does not\nnecessarily imply infertility. Conversely, the presence of menses\ndoes not guarantee fertility. There are limited data regarding\ncontinued fertility after chemotherapy.\n\u2022 Patients should be advised not to become pregnant while on any\nsystemic therapy, and specific drug package inserts should be\nconsulted for recommendations.\n\u2022 A prospective trial (Partridge AH, Niman SM, Ruggeri M, et al.\nBreast 2021;59:327-338) evaluated premenopausal patients who\nhad completed between 18\u201330 months of endocrine therapy before\ntemporarily interrupting endocrine therapy for up to 2 years to\nallow for pregnancy. At short-term follow-up, the risk of recurrence\nwas not increased among those patients who enrolled or those\nwho became pregnant. This approach is an option for patients who\ndesire pregnancy, although long-term safety is still unknown.\n\u2022 Although data are limited, hormone-based birth control is\ndiscouraged regardless of the HR status of the patient's cancer.\n\u2022 Alternative methods of birth control include intrauterine devices\n(IUDs), barrier methods, or, for patients with no intent of future\npregnancies, tubal ligation or vasectomy for the partner.\n\u2022 Randomized trials have shown that ovarian suppression with\nGnRH agonist therapy administered during adjuvant chemotherapy\nin premenopausal patients with breast tumors (regardless of HR\nstatus) may preserve ovarian function and diminish the likelihood of\nchemotherapy-induced amenorrhea.\n\u2022 Smaller historical experiences in patients with ER-positive disease\nhave reported conflicting results with regard to the protective effect\nof GnRH agonist therapy on fertility.\n\u2022 Breastfeeding following breast-conservation cancer treatment is\nnot contraindicated. However, the quantity and quality of breast\nmilk produced by the conserved breast may not be sufficient or\nmay be lacking some of the nutrients needed. Breastfeeding is\nnot recommended during active treatment with chemotherapy and\nendocrine therapy or within 6 months of completing trastuzumab or\npertuzumab.\nThe general considerations for fertility and sexual health/function outlined for specific populations in NCCN Guidelines for\nAdolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology and NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship are applicable to all patients diagnosed with\nbreast cancer.

In this setting, \u201cno ink on tumor\u201d is recommended for either DCIS or invasive\ncancer cells, primarily because the natural history, treatment, and outcomes of these lesions are more similar to invasive cancer than DCIS.\nFor specifically challenging cases, clinical judgment and discussion with the patient should precede routine re-excision.\n\u2022 These margin recommendations cannot be applied directly to patients undergoing APBI/PBI,1 where data regarding local recurrence are\nmore limited. Furthermore, individualized clinical judgment should be utilized on a case-by-case basis, using postoperative mammography\nto identify residual calcifications and clinical-pathologic factors such as quantitative extent of disease near margin, presence of extensive\nintraductal component (EIC),3 young age, or multiple close margins to assist in identifying patients who may have an increased risk of IBTR\nand therefore may be selected to benefit from re-excision.\n\u2022 For patients with invasive breast cancer after BCS, with microscopically focally positive margins (in the absence of an EIC),3 the use of a\nhigher radiation boost dose to the tumor bed may be considered, since generally a boost to the tumor bed is recommended for patients at\nhigher risk of recurrence.

      "summary": "5 OF 7\nGeneral Principles of Breast Reconstruction\n\u2022 Breast reconstruction may be an option for any patient receiving surgical treatment for breast cancer. All patients undergoing breast\ncancer treatment should be educated about breast reconstructive options as adapted to their individual clinical situation. However,\nbreast reconstruction should not interfere with the appropriate surgical, medical, and radiation management of the cancer or the scope of\nappropriate surgical treatment for this disease. Coordinating consultation and surgical treatment with a reconstructive surgeon should be\nexecuted within a reasonable time frame. The process of breast reconstruction should not govern the timing or the scope of appropriate\nsurgical treatment for this disease. The availability of or the practicality of breast reconstruction should not result in the delay or refusal of\nappropriate surgical, medical, and radiation intervention.\n\u2022 Some patients may choose not to have reconstruction after mastectomy. The option to undergo mastectomy alone with a surgically\noptimized closure should be offered to all patients as part of a comprehensive discussion of reconstructive options. Achieving the optimal\nresult in this scenario may require additional procedures beyond the initial mastectomy. See BINV-H (6) for patient factors influencing choice\nof reconstruction.\n\u2022 Selection of reconstructive option and timing of reconstruction option is based on an assessment of cancer treatment, body habits of\npatients, obesity, smoking history, comorbidities, and patient concerns. Smoking and obesity (WHO Class 2 and 3) increase the risk of\nperioperative complications for all types of breast reconstruction. Patients with these high-risk factors should be counseled about their\nincreased risk for complications following breast reconstruction, including donor site complications/hernias and bulges of the abdominal\nwall, delayed healing, mastectomy skin flap necrosis, total flap failure (obesity), and implant failure (smoking).\n\u2022 Nipple areolar reconstruction should be offered to patients if the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) has been removed as part of their cancer\ntreatment. Various techniques are available for nipple reconstruction. Three-dimensional (3-D) tattooing can be offered to patients as an\noption for NAC reconstruction.\n\u2022 Additionally, patients who are not satisfied with the cosmetic outcome following completion of breast cancer treatment should be offered\nreconstructive surgery consultation.\n\u2022 Patients known to harbor genetic mutations that increase the risk of breast cancer may opt to undergo bilateral prophylactic mastectomies\nwith reconstruction. Reconstruction can be performed with prosthetic, autologous tissue, or a combination of implant with autologous\ntissue.\n\u2022 Skin-sparing mastectomy should be performed by an experienced breast surgery team that works in a coordinated, multidisciplinary fashion\nto guide proper patient selection for skin-sparing mastectomy, determine optimal sequencing of the reconstructive procedure(s) in relation\nto adjuvant therapies, and perform a resection that achieves appropriate surgical margins.\n\u2022 Revisional surgery may be necessary after breast reconstruction. This may include procedures such as fat grafting, mastopexy, direct\nexcision/suction-assisted lipectomy, contralateral procedures (in cases of unilateral reconstruction), and others. Patients should be informed\nbefore reconstruction that revision surgery may be necessary.\nPRINCIPLES OF BREAST RECONSTRUCTION AFTER SURGERY"

Individual patients present preoperatively with\na variety of factors that may impact the choice of reconstruction, the risk of complications, donor site morbidity, and aesthetic result. Each\nof these factors must be taken into account, along with patient desire, to choose the optimal method of reconstruction.\n\u2022 Patient desire\n\u0017The patient may have a strong feeling towards one form of reconstruction after being given the options. Breast reconstruction should be a\nshared decision.\n\u2022 Medical comorbidities\n\u0017Medical comorbidities may preclude longer reconstructive procedures such as autologous tissue reconstruction in some patients.\n\u0017The selection of the reconstructive method of choice should take into consideration patient comorbidities.\n\u0017Poorly controlled diabetes is a risk factor for postoperative complications in both implant and autologous tissue reconstruction.\n\u0017Patients should be screened for personal or familial thrombophilia. Thrombophilia may result in reconstructive failure of microsurgical\nreconstruction or thromboembolic events.\n\u2022 Tobacco use\n\u0017Smoking has been associated with increased risk of delayed wound healing, mastectomy flap necrosis, NAC necrosis in the setting of\nnipple-sparing mastectomy, infection, and failure of implant-based reconstruction. In free flap reconstruction, smoking increases the risk\nof donor complications. Patients should be encouraged to stop smoking prior to reconstruction.\n\u0017Smoking has not definitively been shown to increase the risk of microvascular thrombosis in free flap breast reconstruction.\n\u2022 Breast size/shape\n\u0017If patient has significant macromastia or ptosis, consideration can be given to a reduction pattern mastectomy with either implant-based or\nautologous tissue reconstruction, or oncoplastic reduction techniques.\n\u0017The volume limitations of implants may preclude an acceptable reconstruction in patients with macromastia if preservation of volume is a\npriority.\n\u2022 BMI\n\u0017Patients with a markedly elevated BMI may be at increased risk of infectious complications and seromas as well as donor site\ncomplications from autologous reconstruction, including delayed healing and hernia formation. Immediate reconstruction can be\nperformed, but delayed reconstruction can be considered if the patient is motivated to lose weight. Oncoplastic reduction techniques can\nbe considered if the breast is large/ptotic.\n\u2022 Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) and other rare implant-associated malignancies\n\u0017BIA-ALCL commonly presents with delayed periprosthetic effusion and breast asymmetry occurring >1 year after implantation.\n\u0017Rarely, BIA-ALCL can present with a mass, regional lymphadenopathy, overlying skin rash, and/or capsular contracture.\n\u0017Similar symptoms can also be seen in breast implant associated squamous cell carcinoma (BIA-SCC), another rare implant associated\nmalignancy. Individuals with breast implants have a very small risk of developing BIA-ALCL (average 7\u20139 years after implantation) and BIA-\nSCC (average 22 years after implantation).\n\u0017The majority of cases of BIA-ALCL have been seen in textured implants, while BIA-SCC is associated with either smooth or textured\nimplants. Rare cases of implant associated diffuse large B-cell lymphomas have also been reported. See NCCN Guidelines for T-Cell\nLymphomas.\nPRINCIPLES OF BREAST RECONSTRUCTION AFTER SURGERY"

In patients with large or significantly ptotic\nbreasts, NAC-sparing mastectomies may be offered in select cases by using various reduction patterns or delay techniques to augment\nthe NAC perfusion, either in an immediate or delayed fashion, as long as it does not delay oncologic care. Intraoperative assessment of the\nNAC perfusion should also guide the decision to preserve the NAC or remove it.\n\u0017Patients should be counseled on the risk of delayed healing, nipple necrosis, loss of pigmentation, loss of sensation, loss of projection,\nand need for subsequent removal of the NAC.\n\u0017Topical 2% nitroglycerine (45 mg total dose) used prophylactically has been shown to reduce mastectomy skin flap necrosis in both skin-\nsparing mastectomy and nipple sparing mastectomy in one randomized control trial.\n\u2022 Inflammatory breast cancer\n\u0017Delayed reconstruction after mastectomy for IBC remains the clinical standard for several reasons. The need to resect involved skin\nnegates the benefit of skin-sparing mastectomy for immediate reconstruction, and high rates of local and distant recurrence warrant\ncomprehensive RNI in a timely fashion, which may be technically more challenging or subject to delay after immediate reconstruction.\n\u0017Advances in multimodal therapy have improved 5-year survival in patients with IBC, justifying clinical studies to see if immediate\nreconstruction may be appropriate for certain patients with IBC, but neither the outcomes nor the clinical features to predict such\noutcomes are known at this time.\n\u0017In the uncommon clinical circumstance that the extent of skin excision at the time of mastectomy precludes primary or local closure,\nreconstruction of the chest wall defect with autologous tissue is necessary, and concomitant immediate reconstruction may be\naccomplished.\nPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Mansoor Wahid on 6/25/2025 11:49:26 AM.

More frequent imaging may be needed for selected cases with\ninconsistent reproducibility. Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) may be utilized with deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) technique to\nreduce normal tissue exposure of the heart, lung or liver.\n\u0017Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) should be used to evaluate dose, normal tissue constraints (ie, heart, lung), and planning target volumes\n(PTVs).\n\u2022 It is common for RT to follow chemotherapy when chemotherapy is indicated.

On this page, the terms males and females refer to sex assigned at birth.\n\u2022 Few males have been included in breast cancer trials.1 Therefore, recommendations regarding management of breast cancer in males are\ngenerally extrapolated from findings of clinical trials focusing on breast cancer in females.\n\u2022 Although there are some biologic and clinical differences between breast cancer in males and females, management of breast cancer in\nmales is similar overall to management of breast cancer in females, with the following special considerations pertinent to male patients2:\n\u0017Genetics: The NCCN Panel recommends consideration of genetic testing for all males with breast cancer (See NCCN Guidelines for\nGenetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, Pancreatic, and Prostate).\n\u0017Breast surgery: Historically, males with breast cancer have undergone mastectomy more often than BCS. However, breast-conservation\ntherapy is increasingly being performed in males and evolving data indicate that breast conservation in males is associated with\nequivalent outcomes to mastectomy and that it is safe and feasible. Decisions about breast conservation versus mastectomy in males\nshould be made according to similar criteria as for females.2-9\n\u0017Axillary lymph node surgery: As in females, SLNB should be performed in the setting of male breast cancer with a clinically node-negative\naxilla.2,4\n\u0017RT: Indications for radiation after breast surgery in males with breast cancer are the same as for females with breast cancer.2,5,10,11\n\u0017Use of molecular assays: Data are limited regarding the use of molecular assays to assess prognosis and to predict benefit from\nchemotherapy in males with breast cancer.2 Available data suggest the 21-gene assay recurrence score provides prognostic information\nin males with breast cancer.12,13\n\u0017Preoperative/adjuvant systemic therapy: Chemotherapy with/without HER2-targeted therapy should be recommended for males with\nbreast cancer according to guidelines for females with breast cancer.2 Options for adjuvant endocrine therapy for males with breast\ncancer include tamoxifen for 5\u201310 years or, if tamoxifen is contraindicated, a GnRH analog plus an aromatase inhibitor. In males, single-\nagent adjuvant treatment with an aromatase inhibitor has been associated with inferior outcomes compared to tamoxifen alone, likely due\nto inadequate estradiol suppression, and is not recommended.2,14-17\n\u0017Follow-up after treatment for early-stage disease: There are only limited data to support screening for breast cancer in males.2 The NCCN\nPanel recommends that bone density be assessed at baseline and every 2 years in males with breast cancer who receive adjuvant GnRH\nanalog therapy. Low bone density should be managed according to standard guidelines.18\n\u0017Systemic therapy for advanced disease: Management of advanced breast cancer in males is similar to that in females; however, it is\npreferred that when an aromatase inhibitor is used, a GnRH analog should be given concurrently.2 Available data suggest single-agent\nfulvestrant has similar efficacy in males as in females.19 CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant,\nmTOR inhibitors, and PIK3CA inhibitors have not been systematically evaluated in clinical trials in males with breast cancer. However,\navailable real-world data suggest comparable efficacy and safety profiles and it is reasonable to recommend these agents to males\nbased on extrapolation of data from studies comprised largely of female participants with advanced breast cancer. Indications for and\nrecommendations regarding chemotherapy, HER2-targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and PARP inhibitors for advanced breast cancer in\nmales are similar to those for advanced breast cancer in females.1\nReferences on BINV-J 2 of 2\nPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Mansoor Wahid on 6/25/2025 11:49:26 AM.

The correlation between pathologic response and long-\nterm outcome is strongest for TNBC, somewhat less so for HER2-positive disease, and least for ER-positive disease.c,d\n\u2022 A number of chemotherapy regimens have activity in the preoperative setting. In general, those chemotherapy regimens recommended in\nthe adjuvant setting may be considered in the preoperative setting. See Preoperative/Adjuvant Therapy Regimens (BINV-M).\n\u2022 Preoperative endocrine therapy alone may be considered for patients with ER-positive disease based on comorbidities or low-risk luminal\nbiology based on clinical characteristics and/or genomic signatures (until desired effect is achieved). Data shows that optimal duration for\nresponse if achieved between 4\u20136 months.e\n\u2022 Patients with HER-2 positive, \u2265cT2 and/or cN+ should be considered for HER2-directed therapy preoperatively.

Care should be taken to follow the procedures outlined in BINV-12 and BINV-14 to assure\nappropriate locoregional management. Not all patients are appropriate candidates for preoperative systemic therapy. Accurate clinical\nstaging at baseline prior to initiation of preoperative systemic therapy is critical. See Potentially Operable Disease: Breast and Axillary\nEvaluation Prior to Preoperative Systemic Therapy (BINV-12).\n\u2022 Tumor response should be routinely assessed by clinical exam and imaging studies (see footnote uu on BINV-13) during delivery of\npreoperative therapy. It is preferred that the standard regimen is completed prior to surgery. If all intended treatment is not completed prior\nto surgery, the remainder may be given in the adjuvant setting. Patients with operable breast cancer experiencing progression of disease\nduring preoperative systemic therapy may be given an alternate systemic regimen or proceed to surgery if deemed resectable.

ECOG-ACRIN\nEAZ171: prospective validation trial of germline predictors of taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy in Black women with early-stage breast\ncancer. J Clin Oncol 2024;42:2899-2907).\n\u2022 Consider cryotherapy of hands and feet to decrease the risk of peripheral neuropathy when receiving taxane therapies.\n\u2022 Consider scalp cooling to reduce incidence of chemotherapy-induced alopecia for patients receiving neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy.\nResults may be less effective with anthracycline-containing regimens.\n\u2022 Alternative taxanes (ie, docetaxel, paclitaxel, albumin-bound paclitaxel) may be substituted for select patients due to medical necessity (ie,\nhypersensitivity reaction). If substituted for weekly paclitaxel or docetaxel, then the weekly dose of albumin-bound paclitaxel should not\nexceed 125 mg/m2.\n\u2022 Sequence of therapies in the adjuvant setting:\n\u0017Chemotherapy and endocrine therapy should be given sequentially, with endocrine therapy given after chemotherapy.\n\u0017Adjuvant olaparib can be given concurrently with endocrine therapy.\n\u0017For sequencing of RT with systemic therapy, see BINV-I (2).\nFor those receiving HER2-targeted therapy:\n\u0017Trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk subcutaneous injection may be substituted for trastuzumab IV; however, dosing and administration\ninstruction differ. Do not substitute trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk for or with ado-trastuzumab emtansine.\n\u0017Pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and hyaluronidase-zzxf subcutaneous injection may be substituted for IV pertuzumab and trastuzumab;\nhowever, the dosing and administration instruction may differ.\nPREOPERATIVE/ADJUVANT THERAPY REGIMENS"

Natural menopause is experienced between ages 42\u201358\nyears.\n\u2022 Breast cancer treatments may affect ovarian function and menses.\n\u0017In those who are premenopausal at the beginning of chemotherapy and who develop chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea, ovarian function\nmay still be intact despite amenorrhea or may resume over time. The likelihood of ovarian function resuming after chemotherapy is higher\namong those aged <40 years.\n\u0017Tamoxifen may cause amenorrhea without inducing menopause in premenopausal individuals.\n\u0017Ovarian function suppression induces amenorrhea and reduces ovarian estrogen synthesis without causing permanent menopause.\n\u2022 Twelve months of amenorrhea alone is insufficient to diagnose menopause with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea or with tamoxifen\n\u00b1 ovarian suppression. FSH and estradiol levels are used to support the diagnosis of menopause; however, clear criteria to guide\ninterpretation of FSH and estradiol in this population is lacking.\n\u0017Tamoxifen may alter FSH levels, limiting its utility in determination of menopausal status.\n\u0017FSH and estradiol should be repeated serially to ensure menopausal status in patients with breast cancer with chemotherapy-induced\namenorrhea.\n\u2022 Evidence-based criteria for the diagnosis of menopause in patients with breast cancer are lacking. Clinical trials in breast cancer have\nutilized a variety of definitions of menopause. Reasonable criteria for determining menopause in patients with breast cancer include any of\nthe following:\n\u0017Prior bilateral oophorectomy\n\u0017Age \u226560 years\n\u0017Age <60 with amenorrhea for \u226512 months in the absence of prior chemotherapy, receipt of tamoxifen, toremifene, or ovarian suppression\nand estradiol and FSH in the postmenopausal range\n\u0017Age <60 years: chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea for \u226512 months with FSH and estradiol in post-menopausal range on serial\nassessments\n\u0017Age <60 years: on tamoxifen with FSH and estradiol level in postmenopausal range\n\u2022 Menopausal status cannot be determined in those receiving ovarian function suppression\nPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Mansoor Wahid on 6/25/2025 11:49:26 AM.

The distinction between HER2 test results of IHC 0/absent membrane staining, IHC 0+/with membrane staining (faint, partial\nmembraine staining in \u226410%), IHC 1+, or 2+/ISH negative is currently clinically relevant for therapy selection.\ne Systemic chemotherapy (eg, oral chemotherapy) is generally preferred in the first-line setting.

Fam-\ntrastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is associated with interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis. Regular monitoring for this serious side effect is recommended.

Datopotamab deruxtecan-dlnk did not meet the OS endpoint in the TROPION-Breast01 trial. Whereas the previously approved\nantibody drug conjugates (ADC), fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki and sacituzumab govitecan have shown a benefit in OS in randomized phase III trials. The benefit\nof using datopotamab deruxtecan-dlnk in patients with prior ADC treatment are not known as the TROPION-Breast01 trial did not include patients with prior ADC\ntreatment.\n\u2020 According to the 5th ESO-ESMO international consensus guidelines (Cardoso F, et al.

      "summary": "1 OF 3\na Rising tumor markers (eg, CEA, CA 15-3, CA 27.29) are concerning for tumor progression, but may also be seen in the setting of responding disease. An isolated\nincrease in tumor markers should rarely be used to declare progression of disease. Changes in bone lesions are often difficult to assess on plain or cross-sectional\nradiology or on bone scan. For these reasons, patient symptoms and serum tumor markers may be more helpful in patients with bone-dominant metastatic disease.\nPRINCIPLES OF MONITORING METASTATIC DISEASE\nMonitoring of patient symptoms and cancer burden during treatment of metastatic breast cancer is important to determine whether the\ntreatment is providing benefit and that the patient does not have toxicity from an ineffective therapy.\nComponents of Monitoring\nMonitoring includes periodic assessment of varied combinations of symptoms, physical examination, routine laboratory tests, imaging\nstudies, and blood biomarkers where appropriate. Results of monitoring are classified as response/continued response to treatment, stable\ndisease, uncertainty regarding disease status, or progression of disease. The clinician typically must assess and balance multiple different\nforms of information to make a determination regarding whether disease is being controlled and the toxicity of treatment is acceptable.\nSometimes, this information may be contradictory. Clinicians should take into account patient preferences through a shared decision-making\nprocess.\nDefinition of Disease Progression\nUnequivocal evidence of progression of disease by one or more of these factors is required to establish progression of disease, either\nbecause of ineffective therapy or acquired resistance of disease to an applied therapy. Progression of disease may be identified through\nevidence of growth or worsening of disease at previously known sites of disease and/or of the occurrence of new sites of metastatic disease.\n\u2022 Findings concerning for progression of disease include:\n\u0017Worsening symptoms such as pain or dyspnea\n\u0017Evidence of worsening or new disease on physical examination\n\u0017Declining performance status\n\u0017Unexplained weight loss\n\u0017Increasing alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), or bilirubin\n\u0017Hypercalcemia\n\u0017New radiographic abnormality or increase in the size of pre-existing radiographic abnormality\n\u0017New areas of abnormality on functional imaging (eg, bone scan, PET/CT)\n\u0017Increasing tumor markers (eg, carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], CA 15-3, CA 27.29)a"

      "summary": "PRINCIPLES OF MONITORING METASTATIC DISEASE\nUse of Objective Criteria for Response/Stability/Progression\n\u2022 The most accurate assessments of disease activity typically occur when previously abnormal studies are repeated on a serial and regular\nbasis. Generally, the same method of assessment should be used over time (eg, an abnormality found on chest CT should generally be\nmonitored with repeat chest CT).\n\u2022 Some non-clinically important variation in measurement of abnormalities by all serial studies is common and expected. Therefore, the use\nof objective and widely accepted criteria for response, stability, and progression of disease are encouraged. Such systems include the\nResponse Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines (Eisenhauer EA, Therasse P, Bogaerts J, et al. New response evaluation\ncriteria in solid tumours: revised RECIST guideline [version 1.1]. Eur J Cancer 2009;45:228-247) and the WHO criteria (Miller AB, Hoogstraten\nB, Staquet M, Winkler A. Reporting results of cancer treatment. Cancer 1981;47:207-214).\n\u2022 Studies of functional imaging, such as radionuclide bone scans and PET imaging, are particularly challenging when used to assess\nresponse. In the case of bone scans, responding disease may result in a flare or increased activity on the scan that may be misinterpreted\nas disease progression, especially on the first follow-up bone scan after initiating a new therapy. PET imaging is challenging because of the\nabsence of a reproducible, validated, and widely accepted set of standards for disease activity assessment.\nPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Mansoor Wahid on 6/25/2025 11:49:26 AM.

The use of anti-HER2 therapy is\ncontraindicated during pregnancy.\ne Survival outcomes of BCT are equivalent to mastectomy in both\nnon-pregnancy and pregnancy-associated BCs. Therapeutic RT\nis generally avoided during pregnancy due to potential risks to\nthe fetus. Mastectomy may be preferred, particularly for early (1st\ntrimester) gestational diagnosis, as early BCS may preclude timely\nadministration of RT.

      "summary": "American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)\nTNM Staging System For Breast Cancer\nPrimary Tumor (T) The T category of the primary tumor is defined by the same criteria regardless of whether it is based on clinical or pathological criteria, or both. The\nT category is based primarily on the size of the invasive component of the cancer. The maximum size of a tumor focus is used as an estimate of disease volume. The\nlargest contiguous dimension of a tumor focus is used, and small satellite foci of noncontiguous tumor are not added to the size. The cellular fibrous reaction to invasive\ntumor cells is generally included in the measurement of a tumor prior to treatment; however, the dense fibrosis observed following neoadjuvant treatment is generally\nnot included in the pathological measurement because its extent may overestimate the residual tumor volume. The clinical size of a primary tumor (T) can be measured\nbased on clinical findings (physical examination and imaging modalities, such as mammography, ultrasound, and MR imaging) and pathological findings (gross and\nmicroscopic measurements). Clinical tumor size (cT) should be based on the clinical findings that are judged to be most accurate for a particular case, although it may\nstill be somewhat inaccurate because the intent of some breast cancers is not always apparent with current imaging techniques and because tumors are composed of\nvarying proportions of noninvasive and invasive disease, which these techniques are currently unable to distinguish. Size should be measured to the nearest millimeter.\nIf the tumor size is slightly less than or greater than a cutoff for a given T classification the size should be rounded to the millimeter reading that is closest to the cutoff.\nFor example, a reported size of 4.9 mm is reported as 5 mm, or a size of 2.04 cm is reported as 2.0 cm (20 mm). The exception to this rounding rule is for a breast\ntumor sized between 1.0 and 1.4 mm. These sizes are rounded up to 2 mm, because rounding down would result in the cancer\u2019s being categorized as microinvasive\ncarcinoma (T1mi) defined as a size of 1.0 mm or less.\nTable 1.

For cases with lymph node involvement with no evidence of primary tumor (e.g.\nT0 N1, etc.) or with breast ductal carcinoma in situ (e.g. Tis N1, etc.), the grade,\nHER2, ER, and PR information from the tumor in the lymph node should be used\nfor assigning stage group.\n3. For cases where HER2 is determined to be \u201cequivocal\u201d by ISH (FISH or CISH)\ntesting under the 2013 ASCO/CAP HER2 testing guidelines, the HER2 \u201cnegative\u201d\ncategory should be used for staging in the Clinical Prognostic Stage Group.\n4. The prognostic value of these Prognostic Stage Groups is based on populations\nof persons with breast cancer that have been offered and mostly treated with\nappropriate endocrine and/or systemic chemotherapy (including anti-HER2\ntherapy)."

The\nAmerican Cancer Society has estimated that 313,510 Americans will be\ndiagnosed with breast cancer and 42,780 will die of disease in the United\nStates in 2024.1,2 The therapeutic options for patients with noninvasive or\ninvasive breast cancer are complex and varied. The NCCN Clinical\nPractice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines\u00ae) for Breast Cancer\ninclude guidelines for clinical management of patients with carcinoma in\nsitu, invasive breast cancer, Paget disease, Phyllodes tumor, inflammatory\nbreast cancer (IBC), male breast cancer, and breast cancer during\npregnancy. These Guidelines have been developed and are updated\ncontinuously by a multidisciplinary panel of representatives from NCCN\nMember Institutions with breast cancer-focused expertise in the fields of\nmedical oncology, surgical oncology, radiation oncology, pathology,\nreconstructive surgery, and patient advocacy.\nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage\nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of\nequity, inclusion, and representation. NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use\nlanguage that is person-first; not stigmatizing; anti-racist, anti-classist,\nanti-misogynist, anti-ageist, anti-ableist, and anti-weight-biased; and\ninclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities.\nNCCN Guidelines incorporate non-gendered language, instead focusing\non organ-specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate\nand more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of\nall sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines will\ncontinue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing\nstatistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do\nnot use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender\ndata are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently.\nIf sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs\npresent, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender\nindividuals.

      "summary": "Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (Tis, N0, M0)\nThe diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has increased since the\nintroduction and increased utilization of screening mammography.\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, over 50,000 cases of DCIS of\nthe female breast will be diagnosed in the United States in 2022.1\nWorkup for DCIS\nThe recommended workup and staging of DCIS includes history and\nphysical examination, bilateral diagnostic mammography, pathology\nreview, determination of tumor estrogen receptor (ER) status, and MRI, as\nindicated.\nFor pathology reporting, the NCCN Panel endorses the College of\nAmerican Pathologists (CAP) Protocol for both invasive and noninvasive\ncarcinomas of the breast.4\nThe NCCN Panel recommends testing for ER status in order to determine\nthe benefit of adjuvant endocrine therapy or risk reduction. This is in\naccordance with the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/CAP\nguidelines,5 which recommend that ER testing of newly diagnosed DCIS to\ndetermine potential benefit of endocrine therapies for breast cancer risk\nreduction and progesterone receptor (PR) testing be considered optional.\nAlthough the tumor HER2 status is of prognostic significance in invasive\ncancer, its importance in DCIS has not been established. To date, studies\nhave either found unclear or weak evidence of HER2 status as a\nprognostic indicator in DCIS,6-9 and no statistically significant benefit to the\nuse of trastuzumab concurrently with radiation in HER2-amplified DCIS.10\nThe NCCN Panel has concluded that HER2 status for DCIS does not alter\nthe management strategy and therefore is not recommended for DCIS.\nGenetic counseling is recommended if the patient is considered to be at\nhigh risk for hereditary breast cancer as defined by the NCCN Guidelines\nfor Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and\nPancreatic.\nThe role of MRI in management of DCIS remains unclear. MRI has been\nprospectively shown to have a sensitivity of up to 98% for high-grade\nDCIS.11 In a prospective, observational study of 193 patients with pure\nDCIS who underwent both mammography and MRI imaging\npreoperatively; 93 (56%) patients were diagnosed by mammography and\n153 (92%) were diagnosed by MRI (P < .0001). Of the 89 patients with\nhigh-grade DCIS, 43 (48%) who were not diagnosed by mammography\nwere diagnosed by MRI alone.11 However, other studies suggest that MRI\ncan overestimate the extent of disease.12 Therefore, the surgical decisions\nfor performing a mastectomy for DCIS should not be solely based on MRI\nfindings alone. If MRI findings suggest more extensive disease than is\nseen on mammography such that a markedly larger resection is required\nfor complete excision, the findings should be verified histologically through\nMRI-guided biopsy of the more extensive enhancement. Studies\nperformed to determine whether the use of MRI reduces re-excision rates\nand decreases local recurrence in patients with DCIS show conflicting\nresults. While several studies suggest no reduction in re-excision rates in\npatients with pure DCIS undergoing breast-conserving surgery (BCS)\nfollowing MRI compared with those who did not undergo preoperative\nMRI,13,14 some have demonstrated a reduction in re-excision rate with use\nof preoperative MRI for DCIS.15,16 One study showed an additional cancer\ndetection rate of 6.2% with preoperative MRI.16 Therefore, the use of\npreoperative MRI remains controversial. The NCCN Panel recommends\nonly performing breast MRI for DCIS in select circumstances where\nadditional information is warranted during the initial workup, noting that the\nuse of MRI has not been shown to increase likelihood of negative margins\nor decrease conversion to mastectomy for DCIS.\nPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Mansoor Wahid on 6/25/2025 11:49:26 AM.

      "summary": "Primary Treatment for DCIS\nThe goal of primary therapy for DCIS is to prevent progression to invasive\nbreast carcinoma. Management strategies for DCIS treatment include\nsurgery (mastectomy or BCS), and/or radiation therapy (RT), followed by\nadjuvant endocrine therapy in eligible patients to reduce risk of recurrence.\nThe choice of local treatment does not impact overall disease-related\nsurvival; therefore, the individual\u2019s preferences for risk reduction must be\nconsidered.\nSeveral prospective randomized trials of pure DCIS have shown that the\naddition of whole breast RT (WBRT) after BCS decreases the rate of\nin-breast disease recurrence,17-24 but not distant metastasis-free survival.25\nA meta-analysis of four large multicenter randomized trials confirmed the\nresults of the individual trials, demonstrating that the addition of WBRT\nafter BCS for DCIS provides a statistically and clinically significant\nreduction in ipsilateral breast events (hazard ratio [HR], 0.49; 95%\nconfidence interval [CI]; 0.41\u20130.58, P < .00001).26 However, these trials\ndid not show that the addition of RT has an overall survival (OS) benefit.\nThe long-term follow-up of the NSABP B-17 trial showed that at 15 years,\nRT resulted in a 52% reduction of ipsilateral invasive recurrence compared\nwith excision alone (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.33\u20130.69, P < .001).23 The OS\nand cumulative all-cause mortality rates through 15 years were similar\nbetween the two groups (HR for death, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.79\u20131.48).23 Similar\nfindings were reported by a large observational study of the SEER\ndatabase that included 108,196 patients with DCIS.27 In a subgroup\nanalysis at 10 years, of 60,000 patients treated with BCS, with or without\nWBRT, a 50% reduction in the risk of ipsilateral recurrence (adjusted HR,\n0.47 [95% CI, 0.42\u20130.53]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) was associated with the addition of\nWBRT. However, in this study, breast cancer-specific mortality was found\nto be similar (HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.67\u20131.10]; P\u2009=\u2009.22).27\nIn contrast, several population-based studies suggest beneficial effects of\nWBRT for DCIS after BCS; for example, the use of WBRT in patients with\nhigher-risk DCIS (eg, higher nuclear grade, younger age, larger tumor\nsize) was demonstrated to be associated with a modest but statistically\nsignificant improvement in OS.28 In another observational study of the\nSEER database including 140,366 patients with DCIS, the 15-year breast\ncancer mortality rate was 1.7% for those treated with breast-conserving\ntherapy (BCT) versus 2.3% for patients treated with BCS alone (HR, 0.77;\n95% CI, 0.67\u20130.88; P\u2009<\u2009.001), demonstrating a small but significant\nreduction in breast cancer mortality with BCS and WBRT compared with\nBCS alone.29\nRT Boost: The use of RT boost has been demonstrated to provide a small\nbut statistically significant reduction in ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence\n(IBTR) risk (4% at 20 years) in all age groups for invasive breast\ncancers.30-33\nA pooled analysis of patient-level data from 10 academic institutions\nevaluated outcomes of pure DCIS patients, all treated with BCS and\nWBRT (n = 4131) who either received RT boost with a median dose of 14\nGy (n = 2661) or received no boost (n = 1470). The median follow-up of\npatients was 9 years. A decrease in IBTR was seen in patients who\nreceived a boost compared with those who did not at 5 years (97.1% vs.\n96.3%), 10 years (94.1% vs. 92.5%), and 15 years (91.6% vs. 88.0%) (P =\n.0389 for all). The use of RT boost was associated with significantly\ndecreased IBTR across the entire cohort of patients (HR, 0.73; 95% CI,\n0.57\u20130.94; P = .01).34 In a multivariate analysis that took into account\nfactors associated with lower IBTR, including grade, ER positive status,\nuse of adjuvant tamoxifen, margin status, and age, the benefit of RT boost\nstill remained statistically significant (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53\u20130.91; P <\n.010).34 Even in patients considered very low risk based on negative\nmargins status (defined as no ink on tumor as per NSABP definition, or\nmargins >2 mm as per Society of Surgical Oncology [SSO]/American\nPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Mansoor Wahid on 6/25/2025 11:49:26 AM.

Two randomized phase III trials are studying\nwhether an RT boost reduces recurrence in patients with DCIS\n(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT00470236 and NCT00907868).\nThese trials have completed accrual and are now in active follow-up. A\nrecent publication on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients\nenrolled in the BIG 3-07/TROG 07.01 phase III trial (NCT00470236)\nshowed that after 2 years, the cosmetic status was impacted negatively\nwith the boost versus no boost, suggesting the importance of informed\nshared decision-making regarding addition of boost until data related to\nimpact on local recurrence and OS are published.35 According to the 5-\nyear data from this trial, presented at the 2021 annual San Antonio Breast\nCancer Symposium (SABCS) meeting, 93% of patients in the group who\ndid not receive a boost were free from local recurrence compared with\n97% in the group who received an RT boost (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.31\u2013\n0.72; P < .001).36 The peer-reviewed publication of these data is awaited.\nBreast Conserving Surgery Alone Without WBRT: RT adds to treatment\ncost and is accompanied by adverse effects. Therefore, in an attempt to\nde-escalate treatment and limit morbidity and preserve quality of life\n(QOL), several trials have examined omission of RT in carefully selected\npatients at low risk of disease recurrence.\nThere are retrospective series suggesting that selected patients have a\nlow risk of in-breast recurrence when treated with excision alone (without\nWBRT).37-40 For example, in one retrospective review, 10-year\ndisease-free survival (DFS) rates of 186 patients with DCIS treated with\nBCS alone were 94% for patients with low-risk DCIS and 83% for patients\nwith both intermediate- and high-risk DCIS.37 In another retrospective\nstudy of 215 patients with DCIS treated with BCS without RT, or systemic\nrisk reduction therapy, the recurrence rates over 8 years were 0%, 21.5%,\nand 32.1% in patients with low-, intermediate-, or high-risk DCIS,\nrespectively.38 The stratification for risk of recurrence in this retrospective\nstudy was calculated using the modified Van Nuys Prognostic Index based\non tumor grade, size, absence of comedo necrosis, margin width, and age\nat diagnosis.38\nA multi-institutional, non-randomized, prospective study of selected\npatients with low-risk DCIS treated without radiation has also provided\nsome support for BCS alone without radiation.41 Patients were enrolled\nonto one of two low-risk cohorts: 1) low- or intermediate-grade DCIS,\ntumor size \u22642.5 cm (n = 561); or 2) high-grade DCIS, tumor size \u22641 cm (n\n= 104). Protocol specifications included excision of the DCIS tumor with a\nminimum negative margin width of \u22653 mm. Only 30% of the patients\nreceived tamoxifen. Of note, margins were substantially wider than the 3-\nmm protocol requirement in many patients (ie, the low-/intermediate-risk\npatient group margins were \u22655 mm in 62% of patients and >10 mm or no\ntumor on re-excision in 48% of patients).41 Although the rate of IBTR was\nacceptably low for the low-/intermediate-grade group at 5 years, at a\nmedian follow-up of 12.3 years, the rates of developing an IBTR were\n14.4% for low-/intermediate-grade and 24.6% for high-grade DCIS (P =\n.003). This suggests that IBTR events may be delayed but not prevented\nin the seemingly low-risk population.\nThe RTOG 9804 trial investigated outcomes of RT omission in the setting\nof low-risk DCIS, randomizing 636 patients with low-risk disease to either\nRT or observation after surgery.24 In this study, low risk consisted of low-\nto intermediate-grade DCIS measuring <2.5 cm, with negative margins of\n\u22653 mm. With a median follow-up of 7 years, a reduced risk of local\nrecurrence was seen with use of RT compared with observation (0.9% vs.\n6.7%; HR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.03\u20130.47).

Results from a retrospective study of\n445 patients with pure DCIS treated by excision alone indicated that\nmargin width was the most important independent predictor of local\nrecurrence, although the trend for decreasing local recurrence risk with\nincreasing margin width was most apparent with margins <1 mm\ncompared to \u226510 mm.48 In a meta-analysis of 4660 patients with DCIS\ntreated with BCS and radiation, a surgical margin of <2 mm was\nassociated with increased rates of IBTR compared with margins of 2 mm,\nalthough no significant differences were observed when margins of >2 mm\nto 5 mm or >5 mm were compared with 2-mm margins.49\nA study retrospectively reviewed a database of 2996 patients with DCIS\nwho underwent BCS to investigate the association between margin width\nand recurrence, controlling all other characteristics.50 Wider margins were\nsignificantly associated with a lower rate of recurrence only in patients who\ndid not receive RT (P \u200a< \u200a.0001), but not in those treated with radiation (P \u200a=\n.95).50\nAccording to the DCIS Consensus Guideline on Margins by\nSSO/ASTRO/ASCO, the use of at least a 2-mm margin in DCIS treated\nwith WBRT is associated with low rates of IBTR.47 Additional factors to\nconsider in assessing adequacy of excision for DCIS include presence of\nresidual calcifications, which margin is close (anterior against skin or\nposterior against muscle vs. medial, superior, inferior, or lateral), and life\nexpectancy of the patient. Notably, in situations where DCIS is admixed\nwith invasive carcinoma, the SSO/ASTRO/ASCO Consensus Guideline on\nMargins for invasive breast cancer should be utilized, which supports \u201cno\ntumor on ink\u201d as an adequate margin applying to both the invasive and\nnoninvasive components in this mixed tumor scenario.\nMastectomy: Patients with DCIS and evidence of widespread disease (ie,\ndisease involving two or more quadrants) on diagnostic mammography or\nother imaging, physical examination, or biopsy may require mastectomy.\nFor DCIS patients undergoing mastectomy, or for local excision in an\nanatomic location that could compromise the lymphatic drainage pattern to\nthe axilla (eg, tail of the breast), a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)\nprocedure should strongly be considered at the time of definitive surgery\nto avoid necessitating a full axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for\nevaluation of the axilla.51-54 Since only a small proportion of patients (about\n25%) with seemingly pure DCIS on initial biopsy will have invasive breast\ncancer at the time of the definitive surgical procedure55 and will ultimately\nrequire axillary lymph node (ALN) staging, ALND is not recommended\nunless there is pathologically documented invasive cancer or ALN\nmetastatic disease in patients (by either biopsy or SNLB).\nNCCN Recommendations for Primary Treatment of DCI\nPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Mansoor Wahid on 6/25/2025 11:49:26 AM.

Until such\ntime that definitive evidence regarding the safety of this non-surgical\napproach is demonstrated, the NCCN Panel continues to recommend\nsurgical excision for all DCIS.\nAccording to the NCCN Panel, primary treatment options for patients with\nDCIS along with their respective categories of consensus are:\n1) BCS plus WBRT with or without boost (category 1). While considering\nRT boost for DCIS, the NCCN Panel recommends an individualized\napproach based on patient preference and other factors such as longevity.\nThe NCCN Panel notes that WBRT following BCS reduces IBTR rates in\nDCIS by about 50% to 70%. For DCIS patients treated with BCS alone\n(without radiation), irrespective of margin width, the risk of IBTR is\nsubstantially higher than treatment with excision followed by WBRT (even\nfor predefined low-risk subsets of DCIS patients).\n2) Total mastectomy, with or without SLNB with optional reconstruction\n(category 2A).\n3) BCS plus APBI in carefully selected patients (category 2A). According\nto the Panel, select patients with low-risk DCIS may be considered\nsuitable for APBI if they meet all aspects of the definition of RTOG 9804\nlow-risk DCIS or ASTRO \u201csuitable\u201d DCIS for APBI.\n4) BCS alone (category 2B). The option of BCS alone should be\nconsidered only in cases where the patient and the physician view the\nindividual as having a low risk of disease recurrence. For patients with\nlow-risk disease that has been fully resected with negative margins and\nparticularly if they are ER-positive and will be receiving endocrine therapy,\nthe absolute reduction of in-breast recurrence may not be large enough to\njustify the risks associated with RT. Therefore, according to the NCCN\nPanel, it may be reasonable to omit RT in such cases.\nContraindications to BCT are listed in the algorithm (see Special\nConsiderations to Breast Conservation Therapy Requiring RT). Patients\ntreated with mastectomy are appropriate candidates for breast\nreconstruction (see Principles of Breast Reconstruction Following Surgery\nin the algorithm).\nAccording to the NCCN Panel, complete resection should be documented\nby analysis of margins and specimen radiography. Post-excision\nmammography can be considered for any uncertainty about adequacy of\nthe excision remains (eg, the mass and/or microcalcifications are not\nclearly within the specimen). Clips may be used to delineate the tumor bed\nand ensure adequate coverage with radiation, provide design of boost and\nAPBI fields, and provide markers should additional surgery be required\npending the pathologic margin status review.\nFor patients with pure DCIS treated by BCS and WBRT, a quantitative\ndescription of any tumor close to margin is helpful as a resection width of\nat least 2 mm is associated with a reduced risk of IBTR relative to\nnarrower negative margin widths. The routine practice of obtaining\nmargins >2 mm to further improve outcomes is not supported by the\nevidence. When there is only minimal or focal DCIS involvement near the\nmargin, clinical judgment should be utilized to weigh the risks of re-\nexcision with risk of recurrence for an individual patient.\nFor patients with DCIS treated with excision alone (no WBRT), regardless\nof margin width, there is a substantially higher rate of IBTR than treatment\nwith excision and WBRT, even in predefined, low-risk patients. Although\nthe optimal margin width for treatment with excision alone is unknown, it\nshould be at least 2 mm, with some evidence suggesting improved IBTR\nrates with margin widths wider than 2 mm.\nFor DCIS with microinvasion (DCIS-M), defined as an invasive focus 1 mm\nor smaller in size, the optimal margin width should refer to the DCIS\nPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Mansoor Wahid on 6/25/2025 11:49:26 AM.

The Breast Cancer Prevention Trial performed by NSABP\nshowed a 75% reduction in the occurrence of invasive breast cancer in\npatients with ADH treated with tamoxifen.56,57 These data also showed that\ntamoxifen led to a substantial reduction in the risk of developing invasive\nbreast disease.58 The Early Breast Cancer Trialists\u2019 Collaborative Group\n(EBCTCG) overview analysis showed that, with 5 years of tamoxifen\ntherapy, patients with ER-positive or receptor-unknown invasive tumors\nhad a 39% reduction in the annual odds of recurrence of invasive breast\ncancer.59\nSimilarly, the NSABP B-24 trial found a benefit from tamoxifen for patients\nwith DCIS after treatment with breast conservation surgery and RT. In that\nstudy, patients with DCIS who were treated with BCT were randomized to\nreceive placebo or tamoxifen. At a median follow-up of 13.6 years,\npatients who received tamoxifen had a 3.4% absolute reduction in\nipsilateral in-breast tumor recurrence risk (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.21\u20130.42; P\n< .001) and a 3.2% absolute reduction in contralateral breast cancers (HR,\n0.68; 95% CI, 0.48\u20130.95; P = .023).23 The patients receiving tamoxifen had\na 10-year cumulative rate of 4.6% for invasive and 5.6% for noninvasive\nbreast cancers in the ipsilateral breast, compared with 7.3% invasive and\n7.2% noninvasive recurrences for those treated with placebo.

The phase III\nTAM-01 trial studied a lower dose of tamoxifen (5 mg for 3 years) in 501\npatients with breast intraepithelial neoplasia including DCIS, lobular\ncarcinoma in situ (LCIS), and ADH. The rate of recurrence of either\nintraepithelial neoplasia or invasive breast cancer was 5.7% among those\nreceiving tamoxifen 5 mg daily versus 11.9% for those receiving placebo\n(HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25\u20130.89) at a median follow-up of 5.1 years.61 The\nrelative risk (RR) reduction with low-dose tamoxifen seen in the TAM-01\ntrials is consistent with that seen in trials that used a higher dose of\ntamoxifen, but the rate of severe toxicity compared with placebo was less.\nAnastrozole: In patients with ER-positive and/or PR-positive DCIS treated\nby wide local excision with or without RT, a large, randomized,\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled trial (IBIS-II) compared anastrozole (n =\n1471) with tamoxifen (n = 1509).

Highly selected\npatients with biopsy-proven axillary metastases, who then converted to\nclinically node negative after preoperative systemic therapy, may undergo\nSLNB with removal of the clipped lymph node. This is a currently a\ncategory 2B recommendation as the rate of false negatives is high when\nSLN is performed after preoperative systemic therapy.\nAccording to the NCCN Panel, based on available data, the false-negative\nrate can be reduced by marking biopsied lymph nodes to document their\nremoval, using dual tracer, and by removing 3 or more sentinel nodes\n(targeted ALND).

For example, the IMPORT-LOW\nstudy compared WBRT with partial breast irradiation delivered as 40 Gy in\n15 once-daily fractions using reduced-size breast tangents and found less\nbreast firmness, less change in breast appearance, and lower average\nnumber of adverse events per person with partial breast irradiation.186,189\nThe University of Florence compared WBRT with intensity-modulated\nAPBI (30 Gy in 5 fractions, delivered every other day), and 10-year results\nhave shown that APBI produced less acute and late toxicity and better\ncosmetic outcomes.187 However, the RAPID trial found significantly higher\nrates of fair/poor cosmetic outcome with 3D conformal APBI delivered as\n38.5 Gy in 10 twice-daily fractions.44,190 The majority of APBI patients on\nNSABP B-39 were treated with the same external beam regimen, and\ntreatment-related toxicities were not different for APBI versus WBRT as\ncurrently reported.43 Cosmetic outcome analysis, however, is pending.\nNCCN Recommendation for APBI: The Panel accepts the updated\nASTRO APBI consensus statement for guidance on APBI use.191 The\nNCCN Panel recommends APBI for any BRCA-negative patient who\nmeets the ASTRO 2016 \u201csuitable\u201d criteria defined as age >50 years, ER-\npositive invasive ductal carcinoma measuring \u22642 cm (pT1 disease) with\nnegative margin widths of \u22652 mm, and no lymphovascular invasion (LVI),\nand also permits APBI in patients >50 years of age with screen-detected\nlow- or intermediate-grade DCIS measuring \u22642.5 cm, resected with \u22653 mm\nmargins.

While some experienced breast cancer\nteams have employed protocols in which immediate tissue reconstructions\nare followed by RT, generally RT is preferred to precede autologous\nreconstruction due to the reported loss in reconstruction cosmesis\n(category 2B). When implant reconstruction is planned in a post-\nmastectomy patient requiring RT, the NCCN Panel prefers a staged\napproach with immediate tissue expander placement followed by implant\nplacement. Immediate placement of an implant in patients requiring\npostoperative radiation has an increased rate of capsular contracture,\nmalposition, poor cosmesis, and implant exposure. Surgery to exchange\nthe tissue expanders with permanent implants can be performed prior to\nradiation or after completion of RT.\nIn a previously radiated patient, the use of tissue expanders/implants is\nrelatively contraindicated.231 Tissue expansion of irradiated skin can result\nin a significantly increased risk of capsular contracture, malposition, poor\ncosmesis, implant exposure, and failed reconstruction.232,233 If a patient\nhas previously received RT to the breast, autologous tissue reconstruction\nis the preferred method of breast reconstruction."

Achieving a\npathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant therapy is associated\nwith favorable disease-free and OS in early-stage breast cancer.  The\ncorrelation between pathologic response and long-term outcomes in\npatients with early-stage breast cancer is strongest for patients with\ntriple-negative breast cancer, less so for HER2-positive disease, and least\nfor hormone-positive disease.255-257\nOther benefits of preoperative systemic therapy include allowing time for\nappropriate genetic testing and for planning potential breast reconstruction\nin patients proceeding with mastectomy. For those with significant residual\ndisease after standard preoperative systemic therapy, it may provide an\nopportunity to identify patients who may benefit from further adjuvant\ntherapy after surgery. It many allow sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)\nalone or allow for limited radiation fields if clinically node positive disease\nbecomes clinically node negative after preoperative systemic therapy. In\naddition, preoperative systemic therapy also serves as an excellent\nresearch platform to test novel therapies and predictive biomarkers by\nproviding tumor specimens and blood samples prior to and during\nsystemic treatment.\nSelection of Patients for Preoperative Therapy\nNot all patients are appropriate candidates for preoperative systemic\ntherapy. According to the NCCN Panel, among those with inoperable\nbreast tumors, preoperative systemic therapy is indicated in patients with\nlocally advanced or inoperable breast cancer including those with\ninflammatory breast cancer; those with bulky or matted cN2 axillary nodes;\ncN3 regional lymph node nodal disease; and cT4 tumors.\nIn patients with operable tumors, preoperative systemic therapy is the\npreferred approach for the following scenarios: for patients with TNBC and\nHER2+ breast cancer that is clinical stage T2N0 and higher or is clinically\nnode positive; if the patient\u2019s breast cancer subtype is associated with a\nhigh likelihood of response; or if a patient desires BCS and the size of the\ntumor is large relative to that of the breast.\nWhen preoperative systemic therapy is used to improve the likelihood of\nsuccessful breast conservation, the surgical plan should consider the\npossibility that clear surgical margins may not always be obtained, and a\nfollow-up mastectomy may be required, with or without breast\nreconstruction.

      "summary": "After surgical treatment, adjuvant systemic therapy should be considered.\nIn patients with early-stage breast cancer, systemic adjuvant therapy is\nadministered to reduce risk of cancer recurrence. The decision is often\nbased on individual risk of relapse and predicted sensitivity to a particular\ntreatment (eg, ER/PR and HER2 status). The decision to use systemic\nadjuvant therapy requires considering and balancing risk for disease\nrecurrence with local therapy alone, the magnitude of benefit from\napplying adjuvant therapy, toxicity of the therapy, and comorbidity. The\ndecision-making process requires collaboration between the health care\nteam and patient.\nStratification for Systemic Adjuvant Therapy\nThe NCCN Guidelines stratify, patients with breast cancer based on their\nHR- status and HER2 expression. Patients are then further stratified\nbased on risk of disease recurrence based on anatomic and pathologic\ncharacteristics (ie, tumor grade, tumor size, ALN status, angiolymphatic\ninvasion).\nAdjuvant Systemic therapy for HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors\nPatients with HR positive, HER2-negative tumors, receive adjuvant\nendocrine therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence and those deemed at\nhigh risk for distant recurrence despite adjuvant endocrine therapy,\nreceive adjuvant chemotherapy. The NCCN Guidelines call for the\ndetermination of ER and PR content in all primary invasive breast\ncancers276 to determine whether a patient is a candidate for endocrine\ntherapies. Patients with cancers with 1%\u2013100% ER IHC staining are\nconsidered ER+ and eligible for endocrine therapies. Given the limited\nefficacy data on the ER-low-positive (1%-10%) group, with ER-low-positive\npatients reported to be a heterogeneous group with a natural\nhistory/biologic behavior often similar to ER-negative cancers,\nindividualized consideration of risks versus benefits of endocrine therapy\nand additional adjuvant therapies should be incorporated into decision-\nmaking. Patients with ER-negative, PR-positive cancers may also be\nconsidered for endocrine therapies, however, the efficacy data on this\ngroup are also limited. The same overall interpretation principles apply but\nPR should be interpreted as either positive (if 1%\u2013100% of cells have\nnuclear staining) or negative (if <1% or 0% of cells have nuclear staining).\nFor the purposes of this guideline, any ER and/or PR-positive tumors is\nreferred to as \u2018hormone receptor (HR)-positive\u2019, given that the majority of\nall breast cancers are ER-positive or ER and PR-positive and the\nsubgroup of ER negative/PR-positive tumors are relatively uncommon.\nThe magnitude of risk reduction from adjuvant endocrine therapy is\ndependent on level of ER-expression and on recurrence score (RS) of\ngene expression assay test results. Low level of ER expression is less\nlikely to benefit from endocrine therapy and a high RS will gain less benefit\nwith endocrine therapy alone versus those with low RS.\nPatients with invasive breast cancers that are HR- positive should be\nconsidered for adjuvant endocrine therapy regardless of patient age,\nlymph node status, or whether adjuvant chemotherapy is to be\nadministered.277 Selected studies suggest that HER2-positive breast\ncancers may be less sensitive to some endocrine therapies, although\nother studies have failed to confirm this finding.278-286 A retrospective\nanalysis of tumor blocks collected in the ATAC trial indicated that HER2\namplification is a marker of relative endocrine resistance independent of\ntype of endocrine therapy.287 However, given the favorable toxicity profile\nof the available endocrine therapies, the panel recommends the use of\nPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Mansoor Wahid on 6/25/2025 11:49:26 AM.

The outcome analyses of\n6846 patients with ER-positive disease showed that by extending adjuvant\ntreatment to 10 years, the risk of relapse and breast cancer-related\nmortality was reduced.291 The risk of recurrence during years 5 to 14 was\n21.4% for patients receiving tamoxifen versus 25.1% for controls (absolute\nrecurrence reduction 3.7%). Patients who received tamoxifen for 10 years\nhad a greater reduction in risk of progression, possibly due to a \u201ccarryover\neffect.\u201d The reduction in risk of recurrence was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.79\u20131.02)\nduring 5 to 9 years of tamoxifen treatment and 0.75 (0.62\u20130.90) after 10\nyears of treatment. There were decreases in the incidence of contralateral\nbreast cancer as well. Furthermore, reduced mortality was also apparent\nafter completion of 10 years of treatment with tamoxifen. With regards to\ntoxicity, the most important adverse effects noted in all patients in the\nATLAS trial after with 10 years of tamoxifen treatment were an increased\nrisk for endometrial cancer and pulmonary embolism.291 The results of the\naTTom trial confirm the significant reduction in recurrence and death from\nbreast cancer seen in the ATLAS trial with 10 versus 5 years of tamoxifen\ntherapy.292\nAromatase inhibitors: Several studies have evaluated aromatase inhibitors\n(AI) in the treatment of postmenopausal patients with early-stage breast\ncancer. These studies have utilized AI as initial adjuvant therapy, as\nsequential therapy following 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen, or as extended\ntherapy following 4.5 to 6 years of tamoxifen. The AIs are not active in the\ntreatment of patients with functioning ovaries and should not be used in\npatients whose ovarian function cannot reliably be assessed owing to\ntreatment-induced amenorrhea.\nThe results from two prospective, randomized, clinical trials have provided\nevidence of an OS benefit for patients with early-stage breast cancer\nreceiving initial endocrine therapy with tamoxifen followed sequentially by\nanastrozole (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.28\u20130.99; P = .045) or exemestane (HR,\n0.83; 95% CI, 0.69\u20131.00; P = .05 [excluding patients with ER-negative\ndisease]) when compared with tamoxifen as the only endocrine\ntherapy.293,294 In addition, the NCIC-CTG MA-17 trial demonstrated a\nsurvival advantage with extended therapy with letrozole compared with\nplacebo in patients with ALN-positive (but not lymph node-negative),\nER-positive breast cancer.295 Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors have\ndifferent side effect profiles. Both contribute to hot flashes and night\nsweats and may cause vaginal dryness. AIs are more commonly\nassociated with musculoskeletal symptoms, osteoporosis, and increased\nrate of bone fracture, while tamoxifen is associated with an increased risk\nfor uterine cancer and deep venous thrombosis.\nTwo studies have examined initial adjuvant endocrine treatment with either\ntamoxifen or an AI. The ATAC trial demonstrated that anastrozole is\nsuperior to tamoxifen or the combination of tamoxifen and anastrozole in\nthe adjuvant endocrine therapy of postmenopausal patients with\nHR-positive breast cancer.296,297 With a median of 100 months follow-up,\nPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Mansoor Wahid on 6/25/2025 11:49:26 AM.

Available GnRH agonists in the United States include\ngoserelin and leuprolide. OFS is generally considered in those who are\npremenopausal and for tumors with high enough recurrence risk where the\nadditional absolute decrease in recurrence compared with tamoxifen alone\nis worth the additional toxicity (young age, high-grade tumor, lymph node\ninvolvement). A balanced discussion of the risks and benefits associated\nwith OFS is critical, including the potential side effects of premature\nmenopause.\nIn two randomized trials (TEXT and SOFT), premenopausal patients with\nHR-positive early-stage breast cancer were assigned to receive AI\n(exemestane) plus OFS or tamoxifen plus OFS for a period of 5 years.314\nSuppression of ovarian estrogen production was achieved with the use of\nGnRH agonist triptorelin, oophorectomy, or ovarian irradiation. The DFS\nwas 92.8% in the exemestane plus OFS as compared with 88.8% in the\ntamoxifen plus OFS (HR for recurrence, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55\u20130.80; P <\n.001).314 The OS did not differ significantly between the two groups (HR for\ndeath in the exemestane plus OFS group, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.86\u20131.51; P =\n.37).314\nA 9-year median follow-up analysis of the TEXT-SOFT trials showed\nsustained improvements in DFS with exemestane plus OFS versus\ntamoxifen plus OFS  (HR- 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.90) and in distant\nrecurrence-free interval but not OS (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.22).315\nUltimately, with longer follow-up (median = 13 years), an OS was\ndemonstrated for OFS + exemestane in patients with high-risk of\nrecurrence, but not in .exemestane plus OFS in patients with lower risk of\nrelapse not receiving chemotherapy.316\nThe benefit of OFS in premenopausal patients with high-risk of recurrence\nwas also seen in the results of the ASTRRA trial.

A\nrecent retrospective analysis by the Oxford University studied risk of\nrecurrence for years 5 through 20 after 5 years of endocrine therapy. 318\nThese data showed a considerable risk of recurrence between years 5\nand 20 in these patients treated with initial 5 years of endocrine therapy.318\nData has now emerged showing benefit of extended endocrine therapy in\nimproving DFS.\nData from the ATLAS trial (discussed above)291 and the aTTom trial\nconfirm greater reduction in recurrence and death from breast cancer with\n10 versus 5 years of tamoxifen therapy.292\nFor those treated initially with adjuvant tamoxifen, there is evidence for\nbenefit from extended adjuvant endocrine therapy from several\nrandomized trials.  Results of the MA-17 trial in 5187 patients who had\ncompleted 4.5 to 6 years of adjuvant tamoxifen demonstrated that\nextended therapy with letrozole provides benefit in postmenopausal\npatients with HR-positive, early-stage breast cancer.295,319 With a median\nfollow-up of 64 months, letrozole was associated with improved DFS (HR\n0.52, 95% CI 0.45-0.61) and an improved OS (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.52-0.71)\ncompared with placebo.320\nIn a separate cohort analysis of the MA-17 trial, the efficacy of letrozole\nversus placebo was evaluated after un-blinding of the study in the 1579\npatients who had been randomly assigned to placebo after 4.5 to 6 years\nof tamoxifen.321,322 The median time since completion of tamoxifen was 2.8\nyears. Both DFS and distant DFS were significantly improved in the group\nreceiving letrozole, thereby providing some evidence for the efficacy of\nletrozole in patients who had received 4.5 to 6 years of tamoxifen therapy\nfollowed by no endocrine therapy for an extended period.

In addition, the\nATLAS trial data do not provide clear direction for treatment of\npostmenopausal patients.291 There are no data available to suggest that\nan AI for 5 years is better for long-term benefit than 10 years of tamoxifen.\nIn the extension study of ABCSG trial 6, HR-positive postmenopausal\npatients received 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen and were randomized to 3\nyears of anastrozole or no further therapy.325 At a median follow-up of 62.3\nmonths, patients who received anastrozole (n = 387) were reported to\nhave a statistically significantly reduced risk of recurrence compared with\npatients who received no further treatment (n = 469; HR, 0.62; 95% CI,\n0.40\u20130.96; P = .031).325\nThe differences in design and patient populations among the studies of the\naromatase inhibitors do not allow for the direct comparison of the results of\nthese studies.

In postmenopausal patients, the use of tamoxifen alone for 5 years\n(category 1) or up to 10 years is limited to those who decline or who have\na contraindication to AIs.\nAdjuvant Endocrine Therapy for Premenopausal Patients: If\npremenopausal at diagnosis, the NCCN Panel recommend 5 years of\ntamoxifen alone (category 1) or tamoxifen with OFS (category 1) or OFS\nplus AI for 5 years (category 1). Patients who are premenopausal at\ndiagnosis and who become amenorrheic with chemotherapy may have\ncontinued estrogen production from the ovaries without menses.\nMenopausal status cannot be determined while receiving OFS. AI can\nstimulate ovarian function.  To assure a true postmenopausal status, serial\nassessment of circulating LH, FSH, and estradiol is mandatory when\nconsidering this subset for AI therapy.330,331 Frequency of testing of\nestradiol and FSH/LH levels should be individualized.\nAfter 5 years of initial endocrine therapy, for patients who are\npostmenopausal at that time (including those who have become\npostmenopausal during the 5 years of tamoxifen therapy), the NCCN\nPanel recommends considering extended therapy with an AI for up to 5\nyears (category 1) or based on the data from the ATLAS trial considering\ntamoxifen for an additional 5 years. For those who remain premenopausal\nafter the initial 5 years of tamoxifen, the panel recommends considering\ncontinuing up to 10 years of tamoxifen therapy.\nAdditional considerations during Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy: Symptom\nmanagement for patients on adjuvant endocrine therapies often requires\ntreatment of hot flashes and the treatment of concurrent depression.\nVenlafaxine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) has\nbeen studied and is an effective intervention in decreasing hot flashes.332-\n335 There is evidence suggesting that concomitant use of tamoxifen with\ncertain SSRIs (eg, paroxetine, fluoxetine) may decrease plasma levels of\nPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Mansoor Wahid on 6/25/2025 11:49:26 AM.

Those with one or two variant alleles with\neither reduced or no activity are designated as intermediate\nmetabolizers and poor metabolizers, respectively. The mild CYP2D6\ninhibitors such as citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, and venlafaxine\nappear to have no or only minimal effect on tamoxifen metabolism.330,338,339\nWith respect to CYP2D6 mutation status, a large retrospective study of\n1325 patients found that time to disease recurrence was significantly\nshortened in poor metabolizers of tamoxifen.340 However, the BIG 1-98\ntrial reported on the outcome based on CYP2D6 genotype in a subset of\npostmenopausal patients with endocrine-responsive, early invasive breast\ncancer. The study found no correlation between CYP2D6 allelic status and\ndisease outcome or between CYP2D6 allelic status and tamoxifen-related\nadverse effects.341 A genetic analysis of the ATAC trial found no\nassociation between CYP2D6 genotype and clinical outcomes.342,343\nGiven the limited and conflicting evidence at this time,344 the NCCN Breast\nCancer Panel does not recommend CYP2D6 testing as a tool to determine\nthe optimal adjuvant endocrine strategy. This recommendation is\nconsistent with the ASCO Guidelines.345 When prescribing a selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitor  (SSRI), it is reasonable to avoid potent and\nintermediate CYP2D6 inhibiting agents, particularly paroxetine and\nfluoxetine, if an appropriate alternative exists.\nFor those on tamoxifen, while age-appropriate gynecologic screening is\nrecommended, the use of routine annual pelvic ultrasound is not\nrecommended. For those receiving AI or who experience ovarian failure\nsecondary to treatment should have monitoring of bone health with a bone\nmineral density determination at baseline and periodically thereafter. .The\npanel discourages the selective ER modulators to treat osteoporosis or\nosteopenia in patients with breast cancer. The use of a bisphosphonate\n(oral/IV) or denosumab is recommended to maintain or to improve bone\nmineral density and reduce risk of fractures in postmenopausal (natural or\ninduced) patients receiving adjuvant AI therapy. Optimal duration of either\ntherapy has not been established. The optimal duration and benefits\nbeyond 3 years is not known. Factors to consider for duration of anti-\nosteoporosis therapy include bone mineral density, response to therapy,\nand risk factors for continued bone loss or fracture. There are case reports\nof spontaneous fractures after denosumab discontinuation. Patients\ntreated with bisphosphonates or denosumab should undergo a dental\nexamination with preventive dentistry prior to the initiation of therapy, and\nshould take supplemental calcium and vitamin D.\nThe incremental benefit of adding adjuvant chemotherapy to endocrine\ntherapy in patients with low clinical risk of recurrence such as those with\nvery small, low grade, lymph node-negative tumors is relatively small.346\nThe decision whether or not to administer adjuvant chemotherapy in\npatients with HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors is based on many\nfactors including lymph node status, size, grade, lymphovascular invasion,\nage, comorbid conditions and/or the results of a gene expression profile\ntest using multigene assays.\nSeveral commercially-available gene-based assays are useful in\ndetermining prognosis by predicting distant recurrence, local recurrence,\nor survival. Of these, only one, the 21-gene assay (Oncotype Dx) has\nbeen clinically validated for predicting the benefit of adding adjuvant\nchemotherapy to further reduce the risk of recurrence.\n21-gene assay (Oncotype DX) in Node-negative, HR-positive,\nHER2-negative disease: The 21-gene recurrence score (RS) is one of the\nmost validated multigene assays.

Furthermore,  the HERA trial416\nand the combined analysis of the NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 trials417\nshowed significant improvement in OS with the use of trastuzumab. A\nmore recent meta-analysis of all the above (excluding the BCIRG 006\nTrial) showed that addition of trastuzumab resulted in an average absolute\nreduction in 10-year risk of recurrence of 9.0% (95% CI 7.4 to 10.7; P < .\n0001), a reduction in 10-year breast cancer mortality by 6.4% (4.9 to 7.8;\nP < .0001), and a reduction in mortality (all causes) by 6.5% (5.0 to 8.0; P\n<.0001).418 The benefits of trastuzumab are independent of ER\nstatus.412,419\nThe NCCN Panel considers it reasonable to incorporate pertuzumab into\nthe above adjuvant regimens272,420,421\nThe results of theTRAIN-2 trial showed high pCR rates after treatment\nregimen with anthracycline plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab (67%) and\nalso without anthracycline plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab (68%).420\nPatients who received anthracycline-containing regimen experienced more\nfebrile neutropenia, hypokalemia, and left ventricular ejection fraction\n(LVEF) decline to grade 2 or worse (\u226510% or to <50%).420\nA follow-up analysis of the TRAIN-2 study showed similar 3-year EFS and\nOS with or without anthracyclines in patients with stage II and III HER2-\npositive breast cancer. Based on these results, considering the added\ntoxicity of anthracycline containing regimens the panel has added non-\nanthracycline containing regimens with trastuzumab and pertuzumab as\ntreatment options.422\nThe NCCN panel has included the following regimen as other\nrecommended regimens for HER2-positive disease:\ndoxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by docetaxel + trastuzumab\n(followed by docetaxel + trastuzumab); AC followed by docetaxel +\ntrastuzumab + pertuzumab and paclitaxel/carboplatin + trastuzumab +\npertuzumab.\nRegimens Useful in Certain Circumstances:\nOne year of extended therapy with neratinib after completion of 1 year of\nadjuvant trastuzumab without pertuzumab was evaluated in the phase III\nExteNET trial.  Neratinib improved invasive DFS (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57-\n0.92, P = .0083) primarily in the subgroup of HR-positive tumors (HR 0.60,\n95% CI 0.43-0.83, P = .063).

The optimal frequency of LVEF assessment during adjuvant\ntrastuzumab therapy is not known. The FDA label recommends LVEF\nmeasurements prior to initiation of trastuzumab and every 3 months during\ntherapy.\nAccording to the panel, use of a FDA-approved biosimilar is an\nappropriate substitute for trastuzumab. Trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-\noysk injection approved for subcutaneous use may be substituted for\nintravenous trastuzumab. It is important to note that it has a different\ndosage and administration compared to intravenous trastuzumab.\nAdjuvant Therapy for Tumors of Favorable Histologies\nThe guidelines provide systemic treatment recommendations for the\nfavorable histology of invasive breast cancers (including pure tubular and\npure mucinous cancers, pure cribriform, adenoid cystic secretory\ncarcinoma and other salivary carcinoma, rare low-grade forms of\nmetaplastic carcinoma) based on ER/PR status, tumor size and ALN\nstatus. If used, the treatment options for endocrine therapy,\nchemotherapy, and sequencing of treatment with other modalities are\nsimilar to those of the usual histology of breast cancers. There are rare\nsubtypes of metaplastic carcinoma (eg, low-grade adenosquamous and\nlow-grade fibromatosis-like carcinoma) that have a favorable prognosis\neven without administration of adjuvant systemic therapies.\nThe vast majority of pure tubular, pure mucinous, and pure cribriform\nbreast cancers are both ER-positive and HER2-negative. To be\nassociated with favorable prognosis, the favorable histologic type should\nnot be high grade, should be pure (>90% as classified on the surgical\nexcision, not core biopsy alone), and should be HER-2 negative. If atypical\npathologic or clinical features are present, consider treating as ductal/NST.\nThe pathology evaluation and accuracy of the ER and/or HER2\ndetermination should be reviewed if these are ER-negative and/or\nHER2-positive, or if a tumor with an ER- and PR-negative status is grade\n1.276 Should a breast cancer be histologically identified as a pure tubular or\nmucinous breast cancer and be confirmed as ER-negative, then the tumor\nshould be treated according to the guideline for the usual histology,\nER-negative breast cancers.

Patients should wait 6 to 12 months\nafter the completion of RT to begin their annual mammogram surveillance.\nSuspicious findings on physical examination or surveillance imaging might\nwarrant a shorter interval between mammograms.\u201d\nThe NCCN Panel notes that any imaging of reconstructed breast is not\nindicated.\nAccording to the NCCN Panel, in the absence of clinical signs and\nsymptoms suggestive of recurrent disease, laboratory or imaging studies\nto screen for metastasis are not necessary. The routine performance of\nalkaline phosphatase tests and LFTs are not included in the guidelines.429-\n431 In addition, the Panel notes no evidence to support the use of \u201ctumor\nmarkers\u201d for breast cancer, and routine bone scans, CT scans, MRI scans,\nPET scans, or ultrasound examinations in the asymptomatic patient\nprovide no advantage in survival or ability to palliate recurrent disease and\nare, therefore, not recommended.110,432\nThe use of breast MRI in follow-up of patients with prior breast cancer is\nundefined. It may be considered as an option in patients with high lifetime\nrisk (>20% based on models largely dependent on family history) of\ndeveloping a second primary breast cancer. Rates of contralateral breast\ncancer after either breast-conserving therapy or mastectomy have been\nreported to be increased in patients with BRCA1/2 mutations when\ncompared with patients with sporadic breast cancer.433-435\nThe Panel recommends that patients with intact uteri who are taking\nadjuvant tamoxifen should have yearly gynecologic assessments and\nrapid evaluation of any vaginal spotting that might occur because of the\nrisk of tamoxifen-associated endometrial carcinoma in postmenopausal\npatients.436 The performance of routine endometrial biopsy or\nultrasonography in the asymptomatic woman is not recommended. Neither\ntest has demonstrated utility as a screening test in any population of\npatients. The vast majority of patients with tamoxifen-associated uterine\ncarcinoma have early vaginal spotting.\nIf an adjuvant AI is considered in patients with amenorrhea following\ntreatment, baseline levels of estradiol and gonadotropin followed by serial\nmonitoring of these hormones should be performed if endocrine therapy\nwith an AI is initiated.330 Bilateral oophorectomy assures postmenopausal\nstatus in young patients with therapy-induced amenorrhea and may be\nconsidered prior to initiating therapy with an AI in a young woman.\nSymptom management for patients on adjuvant endocrine therapies often\nrequires treatment of hot flashes and the treatment of concurrent\ndepression. Venlafaxine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor\n(SNRI), has been studied and is an effective intervention in decreasing hot\nflashes.332-335 There is evidence suggesting that concomitant use of\ntamoxifen with certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (eg,\nparoxetine, fluoxetine) may decrease plasma levels of endoxifen, an active\nmetabolite of tamoxifen.336,337 These SSRIs/SNRIs may interfere with the\nenzymatic conversion of tamoxifen to endoxifen by inhibiting a particular\nisoform of CYP2D6.

Predictors of poor\nadherence to medication include the presence of side effects associated\nwith the medication, and incomplete understanding by the patient of the\nbenefits associated with regular administration of the medication.437 The\nPanel recommends the implementation of simple strategies to enhance\npatient adherence to endocrine therapy, such as direct questioning of the\npatient during office visits, as well as brief, clear explanations on the value\nof taking the medication regularly and the therapeutic importance of longer\ndurations of endocrine therapy.\nLymphedema is a common complication after treatment for breast\ncancer. Factors associated with increased risk of lymphedema include\nextent of axillary surgery, axillary radiation, infection, and patient\nobesity.438,439 The Panel recommends educating the patients on\nlymphedema, monitoring for lymphedema, and referring for lymphedema\nmanagement as needed.\nMany young patients treated for breast cancer maintain or regain\npremenopausal status following treatment for breast cancer. For these\npatients, the NCCN Panel discourages the use of hormonal birth control\nmethods, regardless of the HR status of the tumor.440 Alternative birth\ncontrol methods are recommended, including intrauterine devices, barrier\nmethods, and, for those with no intent of future pregnancy, tubal ligation or\nvasectomy. Breastfeeding during endocrine or chemotherapy treatment is\nnot recommended by the NCCN Panel because of risks to the infant.\nBreastfeeding after breast-conserving treatment for breast cancer is not\ncontraindicated. However, lactation from an irradiated breast may not be\npossible, or may occur only with a diminished capacity.440,441\nThe Panel recommends that patients on an adjuvant AI or who experience\novarian failure secondary to treatment should have monitoring of bone\nhealth with a bone mineral density determination at baseline and\nperiodically thereafter. The use of estrogen, progesterone, or selective ER\nmodulators to treat osteoporosis or osteopenia in patients with breast\ncancer is discouraged. The use of a bisphosphonate is generally the\npreferred intervention to improve bone mineral density. A single phase 3\nstudy, ABCSG12, demonstrated improved outcomes with the addition of\nzoledronic acid in premenopausal patients receiving endocrine therapy\nwith ovarian suppression.442 Use of bisphosphonates in such patients and\nin other subgroups remains controversial.

Patients treated with a bisphosphonate should undergo a\ndental examination with preventive dentistry prior to the initiation of\ntherapy, and should take supplemental calcium and vitamin D.\nEvidence suggests that a healthy lifestyle may lead to better breast cancer\noutcomes. A nested case control study of 369 patients with ER-positive\ntumors who developed a second primary breast cancer compared with\n734 matched control patients who did not develop a second primary tumor\nshowed an association between obesity (body mass index [BMI] \u226530),\nsmoking, and alcohol consumption and contralateral breast cancer.443 A\nprospective study of 1490 patients diagnosed with stage I\u2013III breast\ncancer showed an association between high fruit and vegetable\nconsumption, physical activity, and improved survivorship, regardless of\nobesity.444 There is emerging evidence that obesity is associated with\npoorer outcomes for certain subtypes of breast cancers.

      "summary": "Recurrent/Stage IV Breast Cancer\nStaging and Workup for Recurrent and Stage IV Breast Cancer\nThe staging evaluation of patients who present with recurrent or stage IV\nbreast cancer includes: history and physical examination; the performance\nof a CBC, LFTs, chest diagnostic CT, bone scan, and radiographs of any\nlong or weight-bearing bones that are painful or appear abnormal on bone\nscan; diagnostic CT of the abdomen (with or without diagnostic CT of the\npelvis) or MRI scan of the abdomen; and biopsy documentation of first\nrecurrence if possible. The NCCN Panel generally discourages the use of\nsodium fluoride PET or PET/CT scans for the evaluation of patients with\nrecurrent disease. There is limited evidence (mostly from retrospective\nstudies) to support the use of PET/CT scanning to guide treatment\nplanning through determination of the extent of disease in select patients\nwith recurrent or metastatic disease.110,111,449,450 In general, the\nnon-diagnostic CT scans used for PET under-evaluate the lungs and the\nliver compared with contrast-enhanced diagnostic CT scans. The Panel\nconsiders biopsy of equivocal or suspicious sites to be more likely than\nPET/CT scanning to provide accurate staging information in this patient\npopulation.\nThe consensus of the NCCN Panel is that FDG-PET/CT is optional and\nmost helpful in situations where standard imaging results are equivocal or\nsuspicious. The NCCN Panel recommends bone scan or sodium fluoride\nPET/CT (category 2B) to detect bone metastases. However, if the FDG-\nPET results clearly indicate bone metastases, these scans can be omitted.\nThe NCCN Panel recommends that metastatic disease at presentation or\nfirst recurrence of disease should be biopsied as a part of the workup for\npatients with recurrent or stage IV disease. This ensures accurate\ndetermination of metastatic/recurrent disease and tumor histology, and\nallows for biomarker determination and selection of appropriate treatment.\nSoft tissue tumor biopsy is preferred over bone sites unless a portion of\nthe biopsy can be protected from harsh decalcification solution to preserve\nmore accurate biomarker assessment.\nDetermination of HR status (ER and PR) and HER2 status should be\nrepeated in all cases when diagnostic tissue is obtained. ER and PR\nassays may be falsely negative or falsely positive, and there may be\ndiscordance between the primary and metastatic tumors.451,452 The\nreasons for the discordance may relate to change in biology of disease,\ndifferential effect of prior treatment on clonal subsets, tumor heterogeneity,\nor imperfect accuracy and reproducibility of assays.452 Discordance\nbetween the receptor status of primary and recurrent disease has been\nreported in a number of studies. The discordance rates are in the range of\n3.4% to 60% for ER-negative to ER-positive; 7.2% to 31% for ER-positive\nto ER-negative; and 0.7% to 11% for HER2.453-462\nThe NCCN Panel recommends that re-testing the receptor status of\nrecurrent disease be performed, especially in cases when it was\npreviously unknown, originally negative, or not overexpressed. For\npatients with clinical courses consistent with HR\u2013positive breast cancer, or\nwith prior positive HR results, the Panel has noted that a course of\nendocrine therapy is reasonable, regardless of whether the receptor assay\nis repeated or the result of the most recent HR assay.\nGenetic counseling is recommended if the patient is considered to be at\nhigh risk for hereditary breast cancer, as defined by the NCCN Guidelines\nfor Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and\nPancreatic.\nGenetic testing: In the metastatic setting, results from genetic testing may\nhave therapeutic implications. Germline mutations in BRCA1/2 have\nproven clinical utility and therapeutic impact. Therefore, germline BRCA1/2\nmutations should be assessed in all patients with recurrent or metastatic\nbreast cancer to identify candidates for PARP inhibitor therapy.\nPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Mansoor Wahid on 6/25/2025 11:49:26 AM.

The analyses compared\nbreast-conserving therapy with mastectomy in patients with stage I and\nstage II disease. The 133 (approximately 8%) patients experiencing a local\nrecurrence as an initial event were approximately equally divided between\nthose who had undergone mastectomy and those who had received\nbreast-conserving therapy as initial treatment for breast cancer. Of those\nin the former group, 51 (76%) were able to undergo RT with or without\nsurgery as treatment for local disease recurrence.

The use of surgical\nresection in this setting implies the use of limited excision of disease with\nthe goal of obtaining clear margins of resection. Unresectable chest wall\nrecurrent disease should be treated with RT if no prior radiation has been\ngiven.\nIn patients with a local breast recurrence after BCS and RT who had a\nprior sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy, a repeat SLNB may be\nconsidered although the accuracy of repeat SLNB is unproven, and the\nprognostic significance of repeat SLNB after mastectomy is unknown and\nits use is discouraged.465,466 On the other hand, the prognostic significance\nof repeat SLNB after mastectomy is unknown and its use is discouraged.\nThe consensus recommendation of the Panel for most patients with a local\nrecurrence following breast-conserving therapy and SLNB is mastectomy\nand a level I/II axillary dissection.\nThe results of the CALOR trial found that after complete resection in\npatients with isolated locoregional recurrence, adjuvant chemotherapy\nimproves both DFS and OS.467 After a median follow-up of 4.9 years, the\noverall DFS was 69% in the chemotherapy group versus 57% in the group\nthat did not receive chemotherapy (HR, 0.59; P = .046).467 Five-year OS in\nall patients in the study was also significantly improved with chemotherapy\n(88% vs. 76%, P = .024).467 The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy was\nmostly seen in patients with ER-negative disease. Among patients with\nER-negative disease, 5-year DFS was 67% versus 35% (HR, 0.32; 95%\nCI, 0.14\u20130.73) and in those ER-positive disease, the 5-year DFS was 70%\nversus 69% (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.47\u20131.89).467 However these patients\nreceived endocrine therapy.\nAccording to the NCCN Panel, after local treatment, patients with local\nrecurrences only should be considered for limited duration systemic\nchemotherapy or endocrine therapy similar to that outlined in the adjuvant\nchemotherapy section. The Panel emphasized the importance of\nindividualizing treatment strategies in patients with a recurrence of disease\nlimited to a local site.\nPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Mansoor Wahid on 6/25/2025 11:49:26 AM.

NCCN\nrecognizes the importance of clinical trials and encourages participation\nwhen applicable and available.\nSurgery for Recurrent or Stage IV Disease\nThe primary treatment approach recommended by the NCCN Panel for\npatients with metastatic breast cancer and an intact primary tumor is\nsystemic therapy, with consideration of surgery after initial systemic\ntreatment for those requiring palliation of symptoms or with impending\ncomplications, such as skin ulceration, bleeding, fungation, and pain.468\nGenerally such surgery should be undertaken only if complete local\nclearance of tumor may be obtained and if other sites of disease are not\nimmediately life-threatening. Alternatively, RT may be considered instead\nof surgery. Often such surgery requires collaboration between the breast\nsurgeon and the reconstructive surgeon to provide optimal cancer control\nand wound closure.\nRetrospective studies suggest a potential survival benefit from complete\nexcision of the in-breast tumor in select patients with metastatic breast\ncancer.469-472 Substantial selection biases exist in all of these studies and\nare likely to confound the study results.473,474\nTwo prospective, randomized studies assessed whether or not surgery on\nthe primary tumor in the breast is necessary for patients who are\ndiagnosed with metastatic/stage IV breast cancer.475,476 In the first\nprospective trial, patients (n = 350) with de novo metastatic breast cancer\nwho achieved a partial or complete response to anthracycline-based\nchemotherapy were randomly assigned to either surgery of the primary\ntumor plus adjuvant radiation or no locoregional treatment.475 There was\nno difference in the OS between the group that received surgery and the\ngroup that did not (19.2 vs. 20.5 months; HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.81\u20131.34).475\nIn a separate multicenter prospective registry study patients whose\ndisease responded to first-line systemic therapy were randomized to\nmanagement of the primary tumor by surgery or not. 477 Preliminary data\nshowed no difference in OS between the two groups 477\nHowever, in another trial by the Turkish Federation (MF07-01), patients (n\n= 274) with de novo metastatic breast cancer who were randomized to\nlocal management (mastectomy, or BCS with radiation) followed by\nsystemic therapy versus systemic therapy only observed a benefit with\nsurgery.478 While no difference in survival was seen at 36 months, at 40\nmonths, patients treated with local management showed an improvement\nin survival with locoregional treatment (46.4% vs. 26.4%; HR, 0.66; 95%\nCI, 0.49\u20130.88).478 The design of this trial is different from the other, the first\ndifference being the inclusion of two prospective studies described above\nin which patients were included only if they had experienced a response to\nsystemic therapy. Second, randomization in the Turkish trial was not\nbalanced. Patients who received surgery had lower rates of triple-negative\ndisease (7% vs. 17%), visceral metastases (29% vs. 45%), and many had\nsolitary bone metastases only (33% vs. 20%).478 In an unplanned\nsubgroup analysis, patients who appeared to derive the greatest OS\nbenefit from local management included those with HR-positive disease\n(HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.44\u20130.89; P = .008); those with HER2-negative\ndisease (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.45\u20130.91; P = .01); those <55 years (HR,\n0.57; 95% CI, 0.38\u20130.86; P = .007); and those with solitary bone\nmetastases (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.23\u20130.98; P = .04). 478\nThe Panel recognizes the need for more data from randomized clinical\ntrials that will address the risks and benefits of local therapy for patients\nwith stage IV disease while eliminating selection biases.

The median PFS time observed with pertuzumab and\ntrastuzumab combination was 15.5 months (range, 0.9\u201317.0 months; 80%\nCI, 18\u201331 months).562 The reported median duration of response with the\ncombination was 5.8 months (range, 2.9\u201315.3 months).562\nTo determine whether the clinical benefit seen in the study was from\npertuzumab alone or was a result of the combined effect of pertuzumab\nand trastuzumab, a cohort of patients (n = 29) whose disease progressed\nduring prior trastuzumab-based therapy received pertuzumab\nmonotherapy until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. Of these,\npatients with disease progression (n = 17) continued to receive\npertuzumab with the addition of trastuzumab. In the 29 patients who\nreceived pertuzumab monotherapy, the ORR and clinical benefit rate\nreported were 3.4% and 10.3%, respectively, whereas in the patients who\nreceived dual blockade after disease progression while on pertuzumab,\nthe ORR and clinical benefit rate were 17.6% and 41.2%, respectively.563\nAccording to the NCCN Panel, for patients with disease progression after\ntreatment with trastuzumab-based therapy without pertuzumab, a line of\ntherapy containing both trastuzumab plus pertuzumab with or without a\ncytotoxic agent (such as vinorelbine or taxane) may be\nconsidered.

The information includes those from direct\nobservations of the patient, including patient-reported symptoms,\nperformance status, change in weight, and physical examination;\nlaboratory tests such as alkaline phosphatase, liver function, blood counts,\nand calcium; radiographic imaging; functional imaging; and, where\nappropriate, tumor biomarkers. The results of these evaluations generally\nare classified as response, continued response to treatment, stable\ndisease, uncertainty regarding disease status, or progression of disease.\nThe clinician typically must assess and balance multiple different forms of\ninformation to decide, along with the patient, whether disease is being\ncontrolled and the toxicity of treatment is acceptable. Sometimes individual\npieces of information can be conflicting with regard to disease response,\nand clinical judgment along with patient input is critical.\nThe NCCN Panel recommends using widely accepted criteria for reporting\nresponse, stability, and progression of disease such as the RECIST\ncriteria643 and the WHO criteria.644 The Panel also recommends using the\nsame method of response assessment over time. For example, an\nabnormality initially found on diagnostic CT scan of the chest should be\nmonitored with repeat diagnostic CT scans of the chest.\nThe optimal frequency of testing is uncertain and primarily based on the\nmonitoring strategies utilized in breast cancer clinical trials.

      "summary": "Paget disease of the breast is a rare manifestation of breast cancer\ncharacterized by neoplastic cells in the epidermis of the NAC.646 It most\ncommonly presents with eczema of the areola, bleeding, ulceration, and\nitching of the nipple. The diagnosis is often delayed because of the rare\nnature of the condition and confusion with other dermatologic conditions.\nThere is an associated cancer elsewhere in the breast in up to about 80%\nto 90% of cases.647-649 The associated cancers are not necessarily located\nadjacent to the NAC and may be either DCIS or invasive cancer.\nPatients with clinical signs that raise suspicion for Paget disease require a\ncomplete history and physical examination and diagnostic breast imaging.\nAny breast lesion identified by imaging or examination should be\nevaluated according to the NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer Screening\nand Diagnosis. The skin of the NAC should undergo surgical biopsy,\nincluding the full thickness of the epidermis including at least a portion of\nany clinically involved NAC. When biopsy of the NAC is positive for Paget\ndisease, breast MRI is recommended to define the extent of disease and\nidentify additional disease.649,650\nThere are no category 1 data that specifically address local management\nof Paget disease. Systemic therapy is based on the stage and biological\ncharacteristics of any underlying cancer, and is supported by the evidence\ncited in the relevant stage-specific breast cancer treatment guidelines.\nManagement of Paget disease has traditionally been total mastectomy\nwith axillary dissection. Total mastectomy remains a reasonable option for\npatients regardless of the absence or presence of an associated breast\ncancer.648 Data demonstrate that satisfactory local control may be\nachieved with BCS including the excision with negative margins of any\nunderlying breast cancer along with resection of the NAC followed by\nWBRT.651-655 The risk of ipsilateral breast recurrence after\nbreast-conserving NAC resection and RT with or without an associated\ncancer is similar to that with BCS and RT with the typical invasive or in situ\ncancer.\nFor Paget disease without an associated cancer (ie, no palpable mass or\nimaging abnormality), it is recommended that BCS consist of removal of\nthe entire NAC with a negative margin of underlying breast tissue. In\ncases with an associated cancer elsewhere in the breast, the surgery\nincludes removal of the NAC with a negative margin and removal of the\nperipheral cancer using standard breast-conserving technique to achieve\na negative margin. It is not necessary to remove the NAC and the\nperipheral cancer in continuity in a single surgical specimen or through a\nsingle incision. Mastectomy also remains an appropriate treatment option.\nALN staging is not necessary when breast-conserving therapy is used to\ntreat Paget disease with underlying DCIS without evidence of invasive\ncancer following clinical examination, imaging evaluation, and\nfull-thickness skin biopsy of the involved NAC. In the presence of an\nunderlying invasive breast cancer treated with BCS, axillary surgery\nshould be performed according to the Considerations for Surgical Axillary\nStaging outlined in the NCCN Guidelines algorithm. In cases treated by\ntotal mastectomy, axillary staging is recommended for patients with\ninvasive disease and should also be considered for patients with\nunderlying DCIS without evidence of invasive disease. This is because the\nfinal pathology may reveal an invasive cancer in the mastectomy\nspecimen and the mastectomy precludes subsequent sentinel node\nbiopsy. Two retrospective studies have provided evidence for a high\ndegree of accuracy in the identification of the sentinel node(s) in patients\nwith Paget disease.656,657 Patients treated with breast conservation should\nreceive whole breast radiation.

Diagnosis of phyllodes tumors prior to excisional\nbiopsy/lumpectomy is uncommon. Phyllodes tumors occur in an older age\ndistribution than fibroadenoma, a younger age distribution than the\ninvasive ductal and lobular cancers, and with a mean age of 40 years.660\nPhyllodes tumors often enlarge rapidly and are usually painless. Phyllodes\ntumors often appear on ultrasound and mammography as fibroadenomas,\nand FNA cytology and even core needle biopsy are inadequate to reliably\ndistinguish phyllodes tumors from fibroadenomas.660 Thus, in the setting of\na large or rapidly enlarging clinical fibroadenoma, excisional biopsy should\nbe considered to pathologically exclude a phyllodes tumor. Patients with\nLi-Fraumeni syndrome (germline TP53 mutation, see NCCN Guidelines for\nGenetic/Familial High Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic)\nhave an increased risk for phyllodes tumors.661 Local recurrences of\nphyllodes tumors are the most common site of recurrence. Most distant\nrecurrences occur in the lung, and may be solid nodules or thin-walled\ncavities.\nTreatment of phyllodes tumors (which includes benign, borderline, and\nmalignant subtypes) is with local surgical excision with tumor-free margins\nof \u22651 cm. Lumpectomy or partial mastectomy is the preferred surgical\ntherapy. Total mastectomy is necessary only if negative margins cannot\nbe obtained by lumpectomy or partial mastectomy.662 Since phyllodes\ntumors rarely metastasize to the ALNs, surgical axillary staging or ALND is\nnot necessary unless the lymph nodes are pathologic on clinical\nexamination.663 In those patients who experience a local recurrence,\nresection of the recurrence with wide, tumor-free surgical margins should\nbe performed. Some Panel members recommend local RT of the\nremaining breast or chest wall following resection of a local recurrence,\nbut this recommendation is controversial (category 2B).664\nWhile the epithelial component of most phyllodes tumors contains ER\n(58%) and/or PR (75%),665 endocrine therapy has no proven role in the\ntreatment of phyllodes tumors. Similarly, there is no evidence that adjuvant\ncytotoxic chemotherapy provides benefit in reduction of recurrences or\ndeath. In the rare patient who experiences a systemic recurrence (usually\nin the lung), treatment should be as recommended in the NCCN\nGuidelines for Soft Tissue Sarcoma.\nPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Mansoor Wahid on 6/25/2025 11:49:26 AM.

In a California registry study, there were 1.3 breast cancers\ndiagnosed per 10,000 live births.666 Unfortunately, breast cancer during\npregnancy is most often ALN-positive and with larger primary tumor size.\nHistologically the tumors are poorly differentiated, are more frequently\nER/PR-negative, and approximately 30% are HER2-positive.667,668 The\ndiagnosis is often delayed because neither the patient nor the physician\nsuspects malignancy.\nEvaluation of the pregnant patient with suspected breast cancer should\ninclude a physical examination with particular attention to the breast and\nregional lymph nodes. Mammogram of the breast with shielding can be\ndone safely and the accuracy is reported to be >80%.669 Ultrasound of the\nbreast and regional lymph nodes can be used to assess the extent of\ndisease and also to guide biopsy. Ultrasound has been reported to be\nabnormal in up to 100% of breast cancers occurring during pregnancy.669\nBiopsies for cytologic evaluation of a suspicious breast mass may be done\nwith FNA of the breast and suspicious lymph nodes. However, the\npreferred technique is core needle biopsy. This provides tissue for\nhistologic confirmation of invasive disease as well as adequate tissue for\nHR and HER2 analyses.\nStaging assessment of the pregnant patient with breast cancer may be\nguided by clinical disease stage. The staging studies should be tailored to\nminimize fetal exposure to radiation.

Studies on gene expression profiling of IBC\nhave demonstrated that all the subtypes of IBC exist, but basal and HER2\noverexpressed are more frequent.698-701 According to the 7th edition of the\nAJCC Cancer Staging Manual, IBC is classified as stage IIIB, stage IIIC,\nor stage IV breast cancer, depending on the degree of nodal involvement\nand whether distant metastases are present. The primary tumor of IBC is\nclassified as T4d by definition, even when no mass is specifically apparent\nin the breast. On radiographic imaging, findings of skin thickening and, in\nsome cases, an underlying mass are observed. Despite use of the term\n\u201cinflammatory,\u201d the characteristic clinical features of IBC are due to\nblockage of dermal lymphatics by tumor emboli. Although a biopsy is\nrequired to evaluate for the presence of cancer in breast tissue and the\ndermal lymphatics, a diagnosis of IBC is based on clinical findings, and\ndermal lymphatic involvement is neither required, nor sufficient by itself, to\nassign a diagnosis of IBC.702,703 The differential diagnosis includes cellulitis\nof the breast and mastitis.\nIn the past, IBC has often been placed under the general heading of\nlocally advanced breast cancer. There is a growing body of evidence that\npatients with IBC, when compared with patients with noninflammatory\nforms of locally advanced breast cancer, are more likely to have a less\nfavorable prognosis704-706 and to be younger at the time of disease\npresentation.707\nThe NCCN Panel acknowledges that studies focusing on genetic\ncharacterization of IBC are needed to more clearly define IBC as a\ndisease entity and to optimize treatment.708,709 Nevertheless, current\nevidence provides justification for a separate guideline for the workup and\ntreatment of patients diagnosed with IBC.\nStageT4d, N0\u2013N3, M0"

Although treatment of patients with axillary metastases from an\nunknown primary tumor has typically involved mastectomy and axillary\nnodal dissection, some of these patients have also been successfully\ntreated with axillary nodal dissection followed by RT.729,730\nPatients with a suspected occult primary breast cancer will typically\npresent to the oncologist after undergoing an initial biopsy: core needle\nbiopsy (preferred), and/or FNA. Accurate pathologic assessment of the\nbiopsied material is most important. Therefore, the pathologist must be\nconsulted to determine whether the available biopsy material is\nadequate, or if additional biopsy material is necessary (eg, core needle,\nincisional, or excisional biopsy) to provide an accurate and complete\ndiagnosis.\nWorkup for Possible Primary Breast Cancer\nMRI of the breast can facilitate the identification of occult breast cancer,\nand can help select those patients most likely to benefit from\nmastectomy.731 For example, in a study of 40 patients with biopsy-proven\nbreast cancer in the axilla, and a negative or indeterminate\nmammogram, MRI identified the primary breast lesion in 70% of the\npatients.729 In addition, of the 7 patients with a negative MRI who\nsubsequently underwent ALND and RT to the whole breast, no evidence\nof local recurrence was evident at a median follow-up of 19 months.\nThe NCCN Guidelines for Occult Primary provide guidance on the\ndiagnosis and initial workup of patients with a suspicious axillary mass\nwithout any signs of a primary tumor. A small subset of these patients\nmay have a primary cancer in the axillary tail of the breast.\nAdenocarcinoma with positive axillary nodes and mediastinal nodes is\nhighly suggestive of a breast primary. Adenocarcinoma in the\nsupraclavicular nodes, chest, peritoneum, retroperitoneum, liver, bone,\nor brain could also indicate primary breast cancer in patients. The\nguidelines suggest the use of a mammogram and breast ultrasound for\nsuch patients.\nTesting for immunohistochemical markers including ER/PR and HER2 is\nrecommended. Elevated ER/PR levels provide strong evidence for a\nbreast cancer diagnosis.732 MRI of the breast should be considered for a\npatient with histopathologic evidence of breast cancer when\nmammography and ultrasound are not adequate to assess the extent of\nthe disease. MRI may be especially helpful in patients with dense breast\ntissue, positive axillary nodes, and suspected occult primary breast\ntumor or to evaluate the chest wall.733 Breast MRI has been shown to be\nuseful in identifying the primary site in patients with occult primary breast\ncancer and may also facilitate breast conservation in selected patients by\nallowing for lumpectomy instead of mastectomy.729,734 In one report, the\nprimary site was identified using MRI in about half of the patients\npresenting with axillary metastases, irrespective of the breast density.735\nThe NCCN Guidelines for Occult Primary also provide recommendations\nfor additional workup, including chest and abdominal CT to evaluate for\nevidence of distant metastases for patients diagnosed with\nadenocarcinoma (or carcinoma not otherwise specified) of the axillary\nnodes without evidence of a primary breast lesion. In particular, breast\nMRI and ultrasound are recommended.

Individuals with breast implants have a very small risk of developing BIA-ALCL (average 7\u20139 years after implantation) and BIA-SCC (average 22 years\nafter implantation).\n\u0017Sub-bullet 4 revised:The majority of cases of BIA-ALCL have been seen in textured implants, while BIA-SCC is associated with either smooth or textured implants.\nRare cases of implant associated diffuse large B-cell lymphomas have also been reported. There exists an association between certain types of textured breast\nimplants and BIA-ALCL. The risk appears to vary based on the method of texturing. Patients with a past or current history of textured implants should follow up with\ntheir reconstructive surgeon.\nBINV-I (1 of 3)\n\u2022 Optimizing Delivery of Individual Therapy, bullet 3 added: In the setting of oligometastatic breast cancer, the currently available data do not support ablative metastasis-\ndirected RT (ie, SBRT) for extending overall survival OS or PFS to provide more durable local control and pain relief.\n\u2022 Whole Breast Radiation, bullet 2, sub-bullet 2 revised: A boost to the tumor bed is recommended in patients at higher risk for recurrence. Typical boost doses are 10\u2013\n16 Gy in 4\u20138 fractions. The boost can be given sequentially after whole breast RT or as a simultaneous integrated boost.

      "note": "Primary Treatment for DCIS\nThe goal of primary therapy for DCIS is to prevent progression to invasive\nbreast carcinoma. Management strategies for DCIS treatment include\nsurgery (mastectomy or BCS), and/or radiation therapy (RT), followed by\nadjuvant endocrine therapy in eligible patients to reduce risk of recurrence.\nThe choice of local treatment does not impact overall disease-related\nsurvival; therefore, the individual\u2019s preferences for risk reduction must be\nconsidered.\nSeveral prospective randomized trials of pure DCIS have shown that the\naddition of whole breast RT (WBRT) after BCS decreases the rate of\nin-breast disease recurrence,17-24 but not distant metastasis-free survival.25\nA meta-analysis of four large multicenter randomized trials confirmed the\nresults of the individual trials, demonstrating that the addition of WBRT\nafter BCS for DCIS provides a statistically and clinically significant\nreduction in ipsilateral breast events (hazard ratio [HR], 0.49; 95%\nconfidence interval [CI]; 0.41\u20130.58, P < .00001).26 However, these trials\ndid not show that the addition of RT has an overall survival (OS) benefit.\nThe long-term follow-up of the NSABP B-17 trial showed that at 15 years,\nRT resulted in a 52% reduction of ipsilateral invasive recurrence compared\nwith excision alone (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.33\u20130.69, P < .001).23 The OS\nand cumulative all-cause mortality rates through 15 years were similar\nbetween the two groups (HR for death, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.79\u20131.48).23 Similar\nfindings were reported by a large observational study of the SEER\ndatabase that included 108,196 patients with DCIS.27 In a subgroup\nanalysis at 10 years, of 60,000 patients treated with BCS, with or without\nWBRT, a 50% reduction in the risk of ipsilateral recurrence (adjusted HR,\n0.47 [95% CI, 0.42\u20130.53]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) was associated with the addition of\nWBRT. However, in this study, breast cancer-specific mortality was found\nto be similar (HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.67\u20131.10]; P\u2009=\u2009.22).27\nIn contrast, several population-based studies suggest beneficial effects of\nWBRT for DCIS after BCS; for example, the use of WBRT in patients with\nhigher-risk DCIS (eg, higher nuclear grade, younger age, larger tumor\nsize) was demonstrated to be associated with a modest but statistically\nsignificant improvement in OS.28 In another observational study of the\nSEER database including 140,366 patients with DCIS, the 15-year breast\ncancer mortality rate was 1.7% for those treated with breast-conserving\ntherapy (BCT) versus 2.3% for patients treated with BCS alone (HR, 0.77;\n95% CI, 0.67\u20130.88; P\u2009<\u2009.001), demonstrating a small but significant\nreduction in breast cancer mortality with BCS and WBRT compared with\nBCS alone.29\nRT Boost: The use of RT boost has been demonstrated to provide a small\nbut statistically significant reduction in ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence\n(IBTR) risk (4% at 20 years) in all age groups for invasive breast\ncancers.30-33\nA pooled analysis of patient-level data from 10 academic institutions\nevaluated outcomes of pure DCIS patients, all treated with BCS and\nWBRT (n = 4131) who either received RT boost with a median dose of 14\nGy (n = 2661) or received no boost (n = 1470). The median follow-up of\npatients was 9 years. A decrease in IBTR was seen in patients who\nreceived a boost compared with those who did not at 5 years (97.1% vs.\n96.3%), 10 years (94.1% vs. 92.5%), and 15 years (91.6% vs. 88.0%) (P =\n.0389 for all). The use of RT boost was associated with significantly\ndecreased IBTR across the entire cohort of patients (HR, 0.73; 95% CI,\n0.57\u20130.94; P = .01).34 In a multivariate analysis that took into account\nfactors associated with lower IBTR, including grade, ER positive status,\nuse of adjuvant tamoxifen, margin status, and age, the benefit of RT boost\nstill remained statistically significant (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53\u20130.91; P <\n.010).34 Even in patients considered very low risk based on negative\nmargins status (defined as no ink on tumor as per NSABP definition, or\nmargins >2 mm as per Society of Surgical Oncology [SSO]/American\nPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Mansoor Wahid on 6/25/2025 11:49:26 AM.

The Breast Cancer Prevention Trial performed by NSABP\nshowed a 75% reduction in the occurrence of invasive breast cancer in\npatients with ADH treated with tamoxifen.56,57 These data also showed that\ntamoxifen led to a substantial reduction in the risk of developing invasive\nbreast disease.58 The Early Breast Cancer Trialists\u2019 Collaborative Group\n(EBCTCG) overview analysis showed that, with 5 years of tamoxifen\ntherapy, patients with ER-positive or receptor-unknown invasive tumors\nhad a 39% reduction in the annual odds of recurrence of invasive breast\ncancer.59\nSimilarly, the NSABP B-24 trial found a benefit from tamoxifen for patients\nwith DCIS after treatment with breast conservation surgery and RT. In that\nstudy, patients with DCIS who were treated with BCT were randomized to\nreceive placebo or tamoxifen. At a median follow-up of 13.6 years,\npatients who received tamoxifen had a 3.4% absolute reduction in\nipsilateral in-breast tumor recurrence risk (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.21\u20130.42; P\n< .001) and a 3.2% absolute reduction in contralateral breast cancers (HR,\n0.68; 95% CI, 0.48\u20130.95; P = .023).23 The patients receiving tamoxifen had\na 10-year cumulative rate of 4.6% for invasive and 5.6% for noninvasive\nbreast cancers in the ipsilateral breast, compared with 7.3% invasive and\n7.2% noninvasive recurrences for those treated with placebo. The\ncumulative 10-year frequency of invasive and noninvasive breast cancer in\nthe contralateral breast was 6.9% and 4.7% in the placebo and tamoxifen\ngroups, respectively. No differences in OS were noted. A retrospective\nanalysis of ER expression in NSABP B-24 suggests that increased levels\nof ER expression predict for tamoxifen benefit in terms of risk reduction for\nipsilateral and contralateral breast cancer development following BCT.60\nA phase III trial randomized patients with excised DCIS to receive WBRT\nor no WBRT and tamoxifen versus no tamoxifen.22 The randomization was\nindependent for each of the two treatments (RT and tamoxifen). With 12.7\nyears of median follow-up, the use of tamoxifen decreased all new breast\nevents (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58\u20130.88; P = .002). The use of tamoxifen\ndecreased ipsilateral and contralateral breast events in the subjects not\ngiven WBRT (ipsilateral HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.59\u20130.98; contralateral HR,\n0.27; 95% CI, 0.12\u20130.59), but not in those receiving WBRT (ipsilateral HR,\n0.93; 95% CI, 0.50\u20131.75; P = .80; contralateral HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.39\u2013\n2.49; P = 1.0).\nThe standard dose of tamoxifen is 20 mg/day for 5 years. The phase III\nTAM-01 trial studied a lower dose of tamoxifen (5 mg for 3 years) in 501\npatients with breast intraepithelial neoplasia including DCIS, lobular\ncarcinoma in situ (LCIS), and ADH. The rate of recurrence of either\nintraepithelial neoplasia or invasive breast cancer was 5.7% among those\nreceiving tamoxifen 5 mg daily versus 11.9% for those receiving placebo\n(HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25\u20130.89) at a median follow-up of 5.1 years.61 The\nrelative risk (RR) reduction with low-dose tamoxifen seen in the TAM-01\ntrials is consistent with that seen in trials that used a higher dose of\ntamoxifen, but the rate of severe toxicity compared with placebo was less.\nAnastrozole: In patients with ER-positive and/or PR-positive DCIS treated\nby wide local excision with or without RT, a large, randomized,\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled trial (IBIS-II) compared anastrozole (n =\n1471) with tamoxifen (n = 1509).

A Korean trial KROG 08-06 studied\nindependent effect on DFS of RT to internal mammary nodes after BCS or\nmastectomy for node-positive disease,192 randomizing patients to RNI with\ninternal mammary RT versus RNI without internal mammary RT. Radiation\nto the internal mammary nodes did not significantly improve the DFS in\npatients with node-positive breast cancer. However, there was a\nstatistically significant benefit in outcomes with internal mammary nodal\nRT for patients with medially or centrally located tumors.192 Conflicting\ndata have arisen from the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group that\nrecently reported 15-year follow-up of their study on RT to internal\nmammary nodes in patients (n = 3089) with positive nodes and early-\nstage breast cancer.193 In this study, RT to the internal mammary nodes\nwas delivered to right-sided patients (n = 1,491), while no RT to internal\nmammary nodes was delivered to left-sided patients (n = 1,598). The\nstudy reported a 15-year improved OS rate of 60.1% with RT to internal\nmammary nodes compared to 55.4% with no RT to internal mammary\nnodes. Improvements were also seen with respect to risk of developing\ndistant recurrence and breast cancer-specific mortality favoring RT to\ninternal mammary nodes.193\nClinical judgment is needed when determining inclusion of the internal\nmammary nodes during RNI. Therefore, the NCCN Panel no longer\nspecifies the fields that should be included for RNI and refers to it as\ncomprehensive RNI. According to the Panel, patient selection should\nconsider risks versus benefits including long-term organ (cardiac and lung)\ntoxicities, comorbidities of the patient, age, and life expectancy. In\nincluding RT to the internal mammary nodes, meticulous treatment\nplanning with normal tissue dose constraints is mandatory.\nRNI After BCS for Node-Negative Disease: The NCCN Panel\nrecommends consideration of comprehensive RNI in patients with\ncentral/medial tumors (in accordance with EORTC 22922 trial criteria) and\nin accordance with the MA.20 criteria: 3 tumors, as well as those with T2\ntumors who have undergone limited axillary dissection (<10 lymph nodes)\nand also have other risk factors, including high-grade histology, ER-\nnegative disease, or LVI.181\nRNI After BCS for Node-Positive Disease: For those with 1 to 3 positive\nnodes, if a patient meets all of the following criteria\u2014has cT1\u2013T2, cN0; did\nnot receive preoperative chemotherapy; and has 1 to 2 positive SLNs\u2014the\nuse of comprehensive RNI with or without the intentional inclusion of the\naxilla is at the discretion of the radiation oncologist. If the patients do not\nmeet all the criteria listed, the NCCN Panel recommends WBRT with\ninclusion of any portion of the undissected axilla at risk (category 1) with\nstrong consideration of comprehensive RNI.\nFor those with 4 or more positive nodes, the NCCN Panel recommends\ncomprehensive RNI with inclusion of any portion of the undissected axilla\nat risk (category 1).\nPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Mansoor Wahid on 6/25/2025 11:49:26 AM.

Based on these results, considering the added\ntoxicity of anthracycline containing regimens the panel has added non-\nanthracycline containing regimens with trastuzumab and pertuzumab as\ntreatment options.422\nThe NCCN panel has included the following regimen as other\nrecommended regimens for HER2-positive disease:\ndoxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by docetaxel + trastuzumab\n(followed by docetaxel + trastuzumab); AC followed by docetaxel +\ntrastuzumab + pertuzumab and paclitaxel/carboplatin + trastuzumab +\npertuzumab.\nRegimens Useful in Certain Circumstances:\nOne year of extended therapy with neratinib after completion of 1 year of\nadjuvant trastuzumab without pertuzumab was evaluated in the phase III\nExteNET trial.  Neratinib improved invasive DFS (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57-\n0.92, P = .0083) primarily in the subgroup of HR-positive tumors (HR 0.60,\n95% CI 0.43-0.83, P = .063).  Neratinib is associated with moderate to\nsevere diarrhea.\nBased on the trials listed in the section for \u201cother recommended regimen\nand the above data from ExteNET, the NCCN panel has included following\nregimens have been included as useful in certain circumstances:\nDocetaxel + cyclophosphamide + trastuzumab; AC followed by paclitaxel\n+ trastuzumab followed by paclitaxel plus trastuzumab, various\nschedules); AC followed by paclitaxel + trastuzumab + pertuzumab,\nvarious schedules); Paclitaxel + trastuzumab + pertuzumab; adjuvant\nneratinib and adjuvant T-DM1.\nTherapeutic duration and Other Considerations in those receiving HER2-\ntargeted therapy\nThe length of trastuzumab administration in the adjuvant setting trials\nlisted above is 12 months. The HERA trial demonstrated no additional\nbenefit extending trastuzumab to 2 years compared with 1 year.\nWith respect to a duration less than 12 months, the results of the\nPERSEPHONE trial showed non-inferiority for 6 months versus 12 months\nof trastuzumab treatment,423 However, the PHARE study observed more\nevents in the 6 month cohort compared to the 12 month cohort, and non-\ninferiority was not established.424 Furthermore, adverse events over time\nPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Mansoor Wahid on 6/25/2025 11:49:26 AM.

While olaparib and talazoparib are FDA-indicated in\nHER2-negative disease, the NCCN Panel supports use in any breast\ncancer subtype associated with germline BRCA1/2 mutations.\nPlatinums: The phase III TNT trial compared docetaxel with carboplatin in\nthe first-line setting in patients (n = 376) with triple-negative breast cancer.\nIn the unselected population, carboplatin was not more active than\ndocetaxel (ORR, 31.4% vs. 34.0%; P\u2009=\u2009.66). 582 Patients with a germline\nBRCA1/2 mutation had a significantly better response to carboplatin than\ndocetaxel (ORR, 68.0% vs. 33.3%, absolute difference, 34.7%; P = .03).\n582 PFS was also improved with carboplatin treatment in patients with\na germline BRCA1/2 mutation (median PFS, 6.8 months vs. 4.4 months);\nno difference was found in OS. However, patients with somatic BRCA1/2\nmutation in the tumor DNA did not appear to have the same advantage.\nFor those with triple-negative recurrent/stage IV breast cancer and\ngermline BRCA1/2 mutations, the NCCN Panel has included platinum\nagents (cisplatin and carboplatin) as preferred treatment options. It is\nunknown how PARP inhibitors compare with platinums in this setting.\nSystemic Chemotherapy for Recurrent or Stage IV Disease\nPatients with HR-negative tumors not localized to the bone or soft tissue\nonly, or that are associated with symptomatic visceral metastasis\nirrespective of HR- or HER-status, or that have HR-positive tumors that\nare refractory to endocrine therapy should receive systemic\nchemotherapy.\nA variety of chemotherapy regimens are felt to be appropriate, as outlined\nin the treatment algorithm. Combination chemotherapy generally provides\nhigher rates of objective response and longer time to progression, in\ncomparison to single-agent chemotherapy. Combination chemotherapy is,\nhowever, associated with an increase in toxicity and is of little survival\nbenefit.583-587 Furthermore, administering single agents sequentially\ndecreases the likelihood that dose reductions will be needed.

      "note": "NCCN Panel finds no compelling evidence that combination\nchemotherapy is superior to sequential single agents. Therefore,\nsequential monotherapy is preferred and combination therapy is useful in\npatients with rapid clinical progression or need for rapid symptom and/or\ndisease control.\nUsually the first-line regimens are given until progression or unacceptable\ntoxicity. Considering what is unacceptable toxicity and considering no\nfurther cytotoxic therapy should be decided together with the patient.\nAdverse effects may require dose reduction and cessation of\nchemotherapy prior to disease progression.\nThe NCCN Panel recommends considering scalp cooling to reduce\nincidence of chemotherapy-induced alopecia for patients receiving\nchemotherapy. The data on efficacy of scalp cooling is mainly from the\nadjuvant setting and also show that results may be less effective with\nanthracycline-containing regimens.588-592\nA meta-analysis showed favorable impact on OS by prolonging treatment\nuntil disease progression.593 In this analysis, data from four studies\ninvolving 666 patients indicated that median OS was increased by 23%\n(95% CI, 9\u201338%; P =\u2009.01) in patients receiving longer durations of\nchemotherapy versus a limited number of cycles.593 In a systematic\nreview, longer durations of chemotherapy demonstrated a marginal\nincrease in OS (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84\u20130.99) and a significant\nimprovement in PFS (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.6\u20130.72), compared with shorter\ndurations.587\nA more recent study of patients (n = 420) with HER2-negative, advanced\nbreast cancer showed that intermittent first-line treatment with paclitaxel\nplus bevacizumab was not inferior to continuous treatment. The median\noverall PFS for intermittent versus continuous treatment was 7.4 months\nand 9.7 months, respectively (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.88\u20131.57). Median OS\nwas 17.5 months versus 20.9 months for intermittent versus continuous\ntreatment (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.00\u20131.91).594\nDetermining the duration of chemotherapy in an individual patient typically\ndepends on the efficacy and tolerability and shared decision-making\nbetween the treating physician and patient.\nMost patients will be candidates for multiple lines of systemic therapy for\npalliation. At each reassessment clinicians should assess the value of\nongoing treatment, the risks and benefits of an additional line of systemic\ntherapy, patient performance status, and patient preferences through a\nshared decision-making process.\nPreferred Chemotherapy Regimens for Stage IV or Recurrent Metastatic"

      "note": "Breast cancer occurring concurrently with pregnancy is an infrequent\nclinical event. In a California registry study, there were 1.3 breast cancers\ndiagnosed per 10,000 live births.666 Unfortunately, breast cancer during\npregnancy is most often ALN-positive and with larger primary tumor size.\nHistologically the tumors are poorly differentiated, are more frequently\nER/PR-negative, and approximately 30% are HER2-positive.667,668 The\ndiagnosis is often delayed because neither the patient nor the physician\nsuspects malignancy.\nEvaluation of the pregnant patient with suspected breast cancer should\ninclude a physical examination with particular attention to the breast and\nregional lymph nodes. Mammogram of the breast with shielding can be\ndone safely and the accuracy is reported to be >80%.669 Ultrasound of the\nbreast and regional lymph nodes can be used to assess the extent of\ndisease and also to guide biopsy. Ultrasound has been reported to be\nabnormal in up to 100% of breast cancers occurring during pregnancy.669\nBiopsies for cytologic evaluation of a suspicious breast mass may be done\nwith FNA of the breast and suspicious lymph nodes. However, the\npreferred technique is core needle biopsy. This provides tissue for\nhistologic confirmation of invasive disease as well as adequate tissue for\nHR and HER2 analyses.\nStaging assessment of the pregnant patient with breast cancer may be\nguided by clinical disease stage. The staging studies should be tailored to\nminimize fetal exposure to radiation. For clinically node-negative T1\u2013T2\ntumors, a chest x-ray (with shielding), liver function and renal function\nassessment, and a CBC with differential are appropriate. In patients who\nhave clinically node-positive or T3 breast lesions, in addition to the\naforementioned tests an ultrasound of the liver and consideration of a\nscreening MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine without contrast may be\nemployed. The documentation of the presence of metastases may alter\nthe treatment plan and influence the patient\u2019s decision regarding\nmaintenance of the pregnancy. Assessment of the pregnancy should\ninclude a maternal fetal medicine consultation and review of antecedent\nmaternal risks such as hypertension, diabetes, and complications with\nprior pregnancies. Documentation of fetal growth and development and\nfetal age by means of ultrasonographic assessment is appropriate.\nEstimation of the date of the delivery will help with systemic chemotherapy\nplanning. In addition, maternal fetal medicine consultation should include\ncounseling regarding maintaining or terminating pregnancy. Counseling of\nthe pregnant patient with breast cancer should include a review of the\ntreatment options, which include mastectomy or BCS as well as the use of\nsystemic therapy. The most common surgical procedure has been\nmodified radical mastectomy. However, BCS is possible if RT can be\ndelayed to the postpartum period,670 and breast-conserving therapy during\npregnancy does not appear to have a negative impact on survival.670,671\nWhen surgery is performed at 25 weeks of gestation or later, obstetrical\nand prenatal specialists must be onsite and immediately available in the\nevent of precipitous delivery of a viable fetus.\nAlthough there are a limited number of isolated case reports and small\nretrospective studies evaluating use of SLNB in pregnant patients,672,673\nthe sensitivity and specificity of the procedure have not been established\nin this setting. Thus, there are insufficient data on which to base\nrecommendations for its use in pregnant patients. Decisions related to use\nof SLNB in pregnancy should be individualized. A review of the relative\nand absolute contraindications to sentinel node biopsy concluded that\nsentinel node biopsy should not be offered to pregnant patients <30 weeks\ngestation.674 There are limited data with only case reports and estimations\nof fetal radiation dose regarding use of radioactive tracer (eg, technetium\n99m sulfur colloid).675-677 Isosulfan blue or methylene blue dye for sentinel\nnode biopsy procedures is discouraged during pregnancy.\nPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Mansoor Wahid on 6/25/2025 11:49:26 AM.

A\ncomprehensive evaluation is essential, as these symptoms could indicate\ndisease progression, treatment effects, or other unrelated medical issues.\n\u2022 Additional health monitoring, management, and immunizations should be\nperformed as appropriate to the prognosis under the care of a PCP.\n\u2022 Patients are encouraged to maintain a therapeutic relationship with a PCP\nthroughout their lifetime.\nTreatment Management and Supportive Care\n\u2022 Regular follow-up discussions about goals of care and care coordination may\nbe necessary to improve both survival and quality of life. Engaging patients in\nthese discussions, including therapy cessation, ensures that care aligns with\ntheir values and preferences.\n\u2022 Surveillance and follow-up plans should be individualized for all patients,\nparticularly older patients, considering comorbidities, functional status, and\nlife expectancy. Personalization of care is key to managing the complexities of\nolder adults or those with multiple medical co-morbidities.\n\u2022 Patients should receive multidisciplinary and interprofessional care that seeks\nto prevent and/or manage morbidities associated with breast cancer or its\ntreatment.\n\u2022 Patients often experience multiple transitions between different care settings\nand healthcare providers.

For these reasons, patient symptoms and serum tumor markers may be more helpful in patients with bone-dominant metastatic disease.\nPRINCIPLES OF MONITORING METASTATIC DISEASE\nMonitoring of patient symptoms and cancer burden during treatment of metastatic breast cancer is important to determine whether the\ntreatment is providing benefit and that the patient does not have toxicity from an ineffective therapy.\nComponents of Monitoring\nMonitoring includes periodic assessment of varied combinations of symptoms, physical examination, routine laboratory tests, imaging\nstudies, and blood biomarkers where appropriate. Results of monitoring are classified as response/continued response to treatment, stable\ndisease, uncertainty regarding disease status, or progression of disease. The clinician typically must assess and balance multiple different\nforms of information to make a determination regarding whether disease is being controlled and the toxicity of treatment is acceptable.\nSometimes, this information may be contradictory. Clinicians should take into account patient preferences through a shared decision-making\nprocess.\nDefinition of Disease Progression\nUnequivocal evidence of progression of disease by one or more of these factors is required to establish progression of disease, either\nbecause of ineffective therapy or acquired resistance of disease to an applied therapy. Progression of disease may be identified through\nevidence of growth or worsening of disease at previously known sites of disease and/or of the occurrence of new sites of metastatic disease.\n\u2022 Findings concerning for progression of disease include:\n\u0017Worsening symptoms such as pain or dyspnea\n\u0017Evidence of worsening or new disease on physical examination\n\u0017Declining performance status\n\u0017Unexplained weight loss\n\u0017Increasing alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), or bilirubin\n\u0017Hypercalcemia\n\u0017New radiographic abnormality or increase in the size of pre-existing radiographic abnormality\n\u0017New areas of abnormality on functional imaging (eg, bone scan, PET/CT)\n\u0017Increasing tumor markers (eg, carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], CA 15-3, CA 27.29)a"

Generally, the same method of assessment should be used over time (eg, an abnormality found on chest CT should generally be\nmonitored with repeat chest CT).\n\u2022 Some non-clinically important variation in measurement of abnormalities by all serial studies is common and expected. Therefore, the use\nof objective and widely accepted criteria for response, stability, and progression of disease are encouraged. Such systems include the\nResponse Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines (Eisenhauer EA, Therasse P, Bogaerts J, et al. New response evaluation\ncriteria in solid tumours: revised RECIST guideline [version 1.1]. Eur J Cancer 2009;45:228-247) and the WHO criteria (Miller AB, Hoogstraten\nB, Staquet M, Winkler A. Reporting results of cancer treatment. Cancer 1981;47:207-214).\n\u2022 Studies of functional imaging, such as radionuclide bone scans and PET imaging, are particularly challenging when used to assess\nresponse. In the case of bone scans, responding disease may result in a flare or increased activity on the scan that may be misinterpreted\nas disease progression, especially on the first follow-up bone scan after initiating a new therapy. PET imaging is challenging because of the\nabsence of a reproducible, validated, and widely accepted set of standards for disease activity assessment.\nPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Mansoor Wahid on 6/25/2025 11:49:26 AM.

Breast MRI\nadvocates note its high sensitivity for evaluation of extent of disease,\nparticularly for invasive cancer and in dense breasts where\nmammographically occult disease is more likely to elude preoperative\ndetection. MRI detractors note that MRI has a high percentage of\nfalse-positive findings, resulting in further diagnostic workup\u2014including\nMRI-guided biopsy\u2014in many circumstances.65-67 MRI findings tend to\noverestimate extent of disease,68 resulting in increased frequency of\nmastectomies.69-72\nMRI findings alone are not sufficient to determine whether BCT is optimal,\nas additional tissue sampling is needed to verify true malignant disease\nwarranting excision. MRI use may increase mastectomy rates by\nidentifying areas of mammographically occult disease that may have been\nadequately treated with radiation after BCS had the disease remained\nundiscovered without MRI.72\nTwo prospective randomized studies have examined the utility of\npreoperative MRI in determining disease extent, and neither demonstrated\nimprovement in rates of re-excision after initial BCS.73,74 Retrospective\nreview of the utility of MRI showed conflicting outcome results\u2014 one with\nbenefit75 and another without.76 One systematic review67 documented that\nbreast MRI staging altered surgical treatment in 7.8% to 33.3% of\npatients;67 however, no differences in local recurrence or survival have\nbeen demonstrated. In addition, there is no evidence that use of breast\nMRI increases rates of margin-negative resection.77,78\nBreast MRI may assist with identification and management of clinically\noccult primary tumors presenting with axillary nodal metastases.79 In\npatients with Paget disease not identifiable on mammography, breast MRI\nmay help determine the extent of disease.80,81 Breast MRI also has utility\nin screening patients with higher than average risk based on family\nhistory.82\nIf breast MRI imaging is performed, a dedicated breast coil, an imaging\nteam experienced with reading breast MRI and performing MRI-guided\nbiopsy, and multidisciplinary management are the standard of care.\nAccording to the NCCN Panel, the use of MRI is optional and is not\nuniversally recommended by experts in the field. Breast MRI may be used\nfor staging evaluation to define extent of cancer, in the adjuvant or\nneoadjuvant setting, to detect the presence of multifocal or multicentric\ncancer in the ipsilateral breast, or as screening of the contralateral breast\ncancer at time of initial diagnosis. Additional indications for breast MRI\ninclude: clinical axillary metastasis with an occult primary cancer; Paget\ndisease of the nipple with breast primary not identified by other breast\nimaging modalities or physical examination; follow-up screening of\npatients with prior mammographically undetected breast cancers; and\nthose whose lifetime risk of a second primary breast cancer is >20%\n(based on models largely dependent on family history).\nPathology Assessment: A central component of the treatment of breast\ncancer is full knowledge of extent of disease and biologic features.

Those with one or two variant alleles with\neither reduced or no activity are designated as intermediate\nmetabolizers and poor metabolizers, respectively. The mild CYP2D6\ninhibitors such as citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, and venlafaxine\nappear to have no or only minimal effect on tamoxifen metabolism.330,338,339\nWith respect to CYP2D6 mutation status, a large retrospective study of\n1325 patients found that time to disease recurrence was significantly\nshortened in poor metabolizers of tamoxifen.340 However, the BIG 1-98\ntrial reported on the outcome based on CYP2D6 genotype in a subset of\npostmenopausal patients with endocrine-responsive, early invasive breast\ncancer. The study found no correlation between CYP2D6 allelic status and\ndisease outcome or between CYP2D6 allelic status and tamoxifen-related\nadverse effects.341 A genetic analysis of the ATAC trial found no\nassociation between CYP2D6 genotype and clinical outcomes.342,343\nGiven the limited and conflicting evidence at this time,344 the NCCN Breast\nCancer Panel does not recommend CYP2D6 testing as a tool to determine\nthe optimal adjuvant endocrine strategy. This recommendation is\nconsistent with the ASCO Guidelines.345 When prescribing a selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitor  (SSRI), it is reasonable to avoid potent and\nintermediate CYP2D6 inhibiting agents, particularly paroxetine and\nfluoxetine, if an appropriate alternative exists.\nFor those on tamoxifen, while age-appropriate gynecologic screening is\nrecommended, the use of routine annual pelvic ultrasound is not\nrecommended. For those receiving AI or who experience ovarian failure\nsecondary to treatment should have monitoring of bone health with a bone\nmineral density determination at baseline and periodically thereafter. .The\npanel discourages the selective ER modulators to treat osteoporosis or\nosteopenia in patients with breast cancer. The use of a bisphosphonate\n(oral/IV) or denosumab is recommended to maintain or to improve bone\nmineral density and reduce risk of fractures in postmenopausal (natural or\ninduced) patients receiving adjuvant AI therapy. Optimal duration of either\ntherapy has not been established. The optimal duration and benefits\nbeyond 3 years is not known. Factors to consider for duration of anti-\nosteoporosis therapy include bone mineral density, response to therapy,\nand risk factors for continued bone loss or fracture. There are case reports\nof spontaneous fractures after denosumab discontinuation. Patients\ntreated with bisphosphonates or denosumab should undergo a dental\nexamination with preventive dentistry prior to the initiation of therapy, and\nshould take supplemental calcium and vitamin D.\nThe incremental benefit of adding adjuvant chemotherapy to endocrine\ntherapy in patients with low clinical risk of recurrence such as those with\nvery small, low grade, lymph node-negative tumors is relatively small.346\nThe decision whether or not to administer adjuvant chemotherapy in\npatients with HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors is based on many\nfactors including lymph node status, size, grade, lymphovascular invasion,\nage, comorbid conditions and/or the results of a gene expression profile\ntest using multigene assays.\nSeveral commercially-available gene-based assays are useful in\ndetermining prognosis by predicting distant recurrence, local recurrence,\nor survival.

The routine performance of\nalkaline phosphatase tests and LFTs are not included in the guidelines.429-\n431 In addition, the Panel notes no evidence to support the use of \u201ctumor\nmarkers\u201d for breast cancer, and routine bone scans, CT scans, MRI scans,\nPET scans, or ultrasound examinations in the asymptomatic patient\nprovide no advantage in survival or ability to palliate recurrent disease and\nare, therefore, not recommended.110,432\nThe use of breast MRI in follow-up of patients with prior breast cancer is\nundefined. It may be considered as an option in patients with high lifetime\nrisk (>20% based on models largely dependent on family history) of\ndeveloping a second primary breast cancer. Rates of contralateral breast\ncancer after either breast-conserving therapy or mastectomy have been\nreported to be increased in patients with BRCA1/2 mutations when\ncompared with patients with sporadic breast cancer.433-435\nThe Panel recommends that patients with intact uteri who are taking\nadjuvant tamoxifen should have yearly gynecologic assessments and\nrapid evaluation of any vaginal spotting that might occur because of the\nrisk of tamoxifen-associated endometrial carcinoma in postmenopausal\npatients.436 The performance of routine endometrial biopsy or\nultrasonography in the asymptomatic woman is not recommended. Neither\ntest has demonstrated utility as a screening test in any population of\npatients.

Predictors of poor\nadherence to medication include the presence of side effects associated\nwith the medication, and incomplete understanding by the patient of the\nbenefits associated with regular administration of the medication.437 The\nPanel recommends the implementation of simple strategies to enhance\npatient adherence to endocrine therapy, such as direct questioning of the\npatient during office visits, as well as brief, clear explanations on the value\nof taking the medication regularly and the therapeutic importance of longer\ndurations of endocrine therapy.\nLymphedema is a common complication after treatment for breast\ncancer. Factors associated with increased risk of lymphedema include\nextent of axillary surgery, axillary radiation, infection, and patient\nobesity.438,439 The Panel recommends educating the patients on\nlymphedema, monitoring for lymphedema, and referring for lymphedema\nmanagement as needed.\nMany young patients treated for breast cancer maintain or regain\npremenopausal status following treatment for breast cancer.

The largest experience in pregnancy has been\nwith anthracycline and alkylating agent chemotherapy.678,679 Collected data\nof chemotherapy exposure in utero indicate that the first trimester has the\ngreatest risk of fetal malformation.680,681 Fetal malformation risks in the\nsecond and third trimester are approximately 1.3%, not different than that\nof fetuses not exposed to chemotherapy during pregnancy. If systemic\ntherapy is initiated, fetal monitoring prior to each chemotherapy cycle is\nappropriate. Chemotherapy during pregnancy should not be given after\nweek 35 of pregnancy or within 3 weeks of planned delivery in order to\navoid the potential for hematologic complications during delivery. Data\nfrom a single-institution prospective study indicate that FAC chemotherapy\n(5-fluorouraci 500 mg/m2 IV days 1 and 4, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 by IV\ninfusion over 72 hours, and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 IV day 1) may\nbe given with relative safety during the second and third trimesters of\npregnancy.679 As reported by Gwyn et al, the median gestational age at\ndelivery was 38 weeks, more than 50% of the patients had a vaginal\ndelivery, and there were no fetal deaths.667 An update of this experience\nreported on 57 patients treated with FAC in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant\nsetting. There were 57 live births. A survey of parents/guardians reported\non the health of 40 children. There was one child with Down syndrome\nand two with congenital abnormalities (club foot, congenital bilateral\nureteral reflux).

There are\nonly case reports of trastuzumab use during pregnancy.687-694 The majority\nof these case reports indicated oligohydramnios or anhydramnios with\nadministration of trastuzumab; fetal renal failure occurred in one case. If\ntrastuzumab is otherwise indicated, it should be administered in the\npostpartum period; the Panel recommends against its use during\npregnancy.\nA single case report of first-trimester exposure to lapatinib during\ntreatment for breast cancer reported an uncomplicated delivery of a\nhealthy female neonate.695\nEndocrine therapy and RT are contraindicated during pregnancy.\nEndocrine therapy and RT, if indicated, should thus not be initiated until\nthe postpartum period.\nCommunication between the oncologist and maternal fetal medicine\nspecialist is essential at every visit and for every treatment decision point\nfor the patient.\nPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Mansoor Wahid on 6/25/2025 11:49:26 AM.

An isolated\nincrease in tumor markers should rarely be used to declare progression of disease. Changes in bone lesions are often difficult to assess on plain or cross-sectional\nradiology or on bone scan. For these reasons, patient symptoms and serum tumor markers may be more helpful in patients with bone-dominant metastatic disease.\nPRINCIPLES OF MONITORING METASTATIC DISEASE\nMonitoring of patient symptoms and cancer burden during treatment of metastatic breast cancer is important to determine whether the\ntreatment is providing benefit and that the patient does not have toxicity from an ineffective therapy.\nComponents of Monitoring\nMonitoring includes periodic assessment of varied combinations of symptoms, physical examination, routine laboratory tests, imaging\nstudies, and blood biomarkers where appropriate. Results of monitoring are classified as response/continued response to treatment, stable\ndisease, uncertainty regarding disease status, or progression of disease. The clinician typically must assess and balance multiple different\nforms of information to make a determination regarding whether disease is being controlled and the toxicity of treatment is acceptable.\nSometimes, this information may be contradictory. Clinicians should take into account patient preferences through a shared decision-making\nprocess.\nDefinition of Disease Progression\nUnequivocal evidence of progression of disease by one or more of these factors is required to establish progression of disease, either\nbecause of ineffective therapy or acquired resistance of disease to an applied therapy. Progression of disease may be identified through\nevidence of growth or worsening of disease at previously known sites of disease and/or of the occurrence of new sites of metastatic disease.\n\u2022 Findings concerning for progression of disease include:\n\u0017Worsening symptoms such as pain or dyspnea\n\u0017Evidence of worsening or new disease on physical examination\n\u0017Declining performance status\n\u0017Unexplained weight loss\n\u0017Increasing alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), or bilirubin\n\u0017Hypercalcemia\n\u0017New radiographic abnormality or increase in the size of pre-existing radiographic abnormality\n\u0017New areas of abnormality on functional imaging (eg, bone scan, PET/CT)\n\u0017Increasing tumor markers (eg, carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], CA 15-3, CA 27.29)a"

Two randomized phase III trials are studying\nwhether an RT boost reduces recurrence in patients with DCIS\n(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT00470236 and NCT00907868).\nThese trials have completed accrual and are now in active follow-up. A\nrecent publication on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients\nenrolled in the BIG 3-07/TROG 07.01 phase III trial (NCT00470236)\nshowed that after 2 years, the cosmetic status was impacted negatively\nwith the boost versus no boost, suggesting the importance of informed\nshared decision-making regarding addition of boost until data related to\nimpact on local recurrence and OS are published.35 According to the 5-\nyear data from this trial, presented at the 2021 annual San Antonio Breast\nCancer Symposium (SABCS) meeting, 93% of patients in the group who\ndid not receive a boost were free from local recurrence compared with\n97% in the group who received an RT boost (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.31\u2013\n0.72; P < .001).36 The peer-reviewed publication of these data is awaited.\nBreast Conserving Surgery Alone Without WBRT: RT adds to treatment\ncost and is accompanied by adverse effects. Therefore, in an attempt to\nde-escalate treatment and limit morbidity and preserve quality of life\n(QOL), several trials have examined omission of RT in carefully selected\npatients at low risk of disease recurrence.\nThere are retrospective series suggesting that selected patients have a\nlow risk of in-breast recurrence when treated with excision alone (without\nWBRT).37-40 For example, in one retrospective review, 10-year\ndisease-free survival (DFS) rates of 186 patients with DCIS treated with\nBCS alone were 94% for patients with low-risk DCIS and 83% for patients\nwith both intermediate- and high-risk DCIS.37 In another retrospective\nstudy of 215 patients with DCIS treated with BCS without RT, or systemic\nrisk reduction therapy, the recurrence rates over 8 years were 0%, 21.5%,\nand 32.1% in patients with low-, intermediate-, or high-risk DCIS,\nrespectively.38 The stratification for risk of recurrence in this retrospective\nstudy was calculated using the modified Van Nuys Prognostic Index based\non tumor grade, size, absence of comedo necrosis, margin width, and age\nat diagnosis.38\nA multi-institutional, non-randomized, prospective study of selected\npatients with low-risk DCIS treated without radiation has also provided\nsome support for BCS alone without radiation.41 Patients were enrolled\nonto one of two low-risk cohorts: 1) low- or intermediate-grade DCIS,\ntumor size \u22642.5 cm (n = 561); or 2) high-grade DCIS, tumor size \u22641 cm (n\n= 104). Protocol specifications included excision of the DCIS tumor with a\nminimum negative margin width of \u22653 mm. Only 30% of the patients\nreceived tamoxifen. Of note, margins were substantially wider than the 3-\nmm protocol requirement in many patients (ie, the low-/intermediate-risk\npatient group margins were \u22655 mm in 62% of patients and >10 mm or no\ntumor on re-excision in 48% of patients).41 Although the rate of IBTR was\nacceptably low for the low-/intermediate-grade group at 5 years, at a\nmedian follow-up of 12.3 years, the rates of developing an IBTR were\n14.4% for low-/intermediate-grade and 24.6% for high-grade DCIS (P =\n.003). This suggests that IBTR events may be delayed but not prevented\nin the seemingly low-risk population.\nThe RTOG 9804 trial investigated outcomes of RT omission in the setting\nof low-risk DCIS, randomizing 636 patients with low-risk disease to either\nRT or observation after surgery.24 In this study, low risk consisted of low-\nto intermediate-grade DCIS measuring <2.5 cm, with negative margins of\n\u22653 mm. With a median follow-up of 7 years, a reduced risk of local\nrecurrence was seen with use of RT compared with observation (0.9% vs.\n6.7%; HR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.03\u20130.47).

Results from a retrospective study of\n445 patients with pure DCIS treated by excision alone indicated that\nmargin width was the most important independent predictor of local\nrecurrence, although the trend for decreasing local recurrence risk with\nincreasing margin width was most apparent with margins <1 mm\ncompared to \u226510 mm.48 In a meta-analysis of 4660 patients with DCIS\ntreated with BCS and radiation, a surgical margin of <2 mm was\nassociated with increased rates of IBTR compared with margins of 2 mm,\nalthough no significant differences were observed when margins of >2 mm\nto 5 mm or >5 mm were compared with 2-mm margins.49\nA study retrospectively reviewed a database of 2996 patients with DCIS\nwho underwent BCS to investigate the association between margin width\nand recurrence, controlling all other characteristics.50 Wider margins were\nsignificantly associated with a lower rate of recurrence only in patients who\ndid not receive RT (P \u200a< \u200a.0001), but not in those treated with radiation (P \u200a=\n.95).50\nAccording to the DCIS Consensus Guideline on Margins by\nSSO/ASTRO/ASCO, the use of at least a 2-mm margin in DCIS treated\nwith WBRT is associated with low rates of IBTR.47 Additional factors to\nconsider in assessing adequacy of excision for DCIS include presence of\nresidual calcifications, which margin is close (anterior against skin or\nposterior against muscle vs. medial, superior, inferior, or lateral), and life\nexpectancy of the patient. Notably, in situations where DCIS is admixed\nwith invasive carcinoma, the SSO/ASTRO/ASCO Consensus Guideline on\nMargins for invasive breast cancer should be utilized, which supports \u201cno\ntumor on ink\u201d as an adequate margin applying to both the invasive and\nnoninvasive components in this mixed tumor scenario.\nMastectomy: Patients with DCIS and evidence of widespread disease (ie,\ndisease involving two or more quadrants) on diagnostic mammography or\nother imaging, physical examination, or biopsy may require mastectomy.\nFor DCIS patients undergoing mastectomy, or for local excision in an\nanatomic location that could compromise the lymphatic drainage pattern to\nthe axilla (eg, tail of the breast), a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)\nprocedure should strongly be considered at the time of definitive surgery\nto avoid necessitating a full axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for\nevaluation of the axilla.51-54 Since only a small proportion of patients (about\n25%) with seemingly pure DCIS on initial biopsy will have invasive breast\ncancer at the time of the definitive surgical procedure55 and will ultimately\nrequire axillary lymph node (ALN) staging, ALND is not recommended\nunless there is pathologically documented invasive cancer or ALN\nmetastatic disease in patients (by either biopsy or SNLB).\nNCCN Recommendations for Primary Treatment of DCI\nPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Mansoor Wahid on 6/25/2025 11:49:26 AM.

The Breast Cancer Prevention Trial performed by NSABP\nshowed a 75% reduction in the occurrence of invasive breast cancer in\npatients with ADH treated with tamoxifen.56,57 These data also showed that\ntamoxifen led to a substantial reduction in the risk of developing invasive\nbreast disease.58 The Early Breast Cancer Trialists\u2019 Collaborative Group\n(EBCTCG) overview analysis showed that, with 5 years of tamoxifen\ntherapy, patients with ER-positive or receptor-unknown invasive tumors\nhad a 39% reduction in the annual odds of recurrence of invasive breast\ncancer.59\nSimilarly, the NSABP B-24 trial found a benefit from tamoxifen for patients\nwith DCIS after treatment with breast conservation surgery and RT. In that\nstudy, patients with DCIS who were treated with BCT were randomized to\nreceive placebo or tamoxifen. At a median follow-up of 13.6 years,\npatients who received tamoxifen had a 3.4% absolute reduction in\nipsilateral in-breast tumor recurrence risk (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.21\u20130.42; P\n< .001) and a 3.2% absolute reduction in contralateral breast cancers (HR,\n0.68; 95% CI, 0.48\u20130.95; P = .023).23 The patients receiving tamoxifen had\na 10-year cumulative rate of 4.6% for invasive and 5.6% for noninvasive\nbreast cancers in the ipsilateral breast, compared with 7.3% invasive and\n7.2% noninvasive recurrences for those treated with placebo. The\ncumulative 10-year frequency of invasive and noninvasive breast cancer in\nthe contralateral breast was 6.9% and 4.7% in the placebo and tamoxifen\ngroups, respectively.

The use of tamoxifen\ndecreased ipsilateral and contralateral breast events in the subjects not\ngiven WBRT (ipsilateral HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.59\u20130.98; contralateral HR,\n0.27; 95% CI, 0.12\u20130.59), but not in those receiving WBRT (ipsilateral HR,\n0.93; 95% CI, 0.50\u20131.75; P = .80; contralateral HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.39\u2013\n2.49; P = 1.0).\nThe standard dose of tamoxifen is 20 mg/day for 5 years. The phase III\nTAM-01 trial studied a lower dose of tamoxifen (5 mg for 3 years) in 501\npatients with breast intraepithelial neoplasia including DCIS, lobular\ncarcinoma in situ (LCIS), and ADH. The rate of recurrence of either\nintraepithelial neoplasia or invasive breast cancer was 5.7% among those\nreceiving tamoxifen 5 mg daily versus 11.9% for those receiving placebo\n(HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25\u20130.89) at a median follow-up of 5.1 years.61 The\nrelative risk (RR) reduction with low-dose tamoxifen seen in the TAM-01\ntrials is consistent with that seen in trials that used a higher dose of\ntamoxifen, but the rate of severe toxicity compared with placebo was less.\nAnastrozole: In patients with ER-positive and/or PR-positive DCIS treated\nby wide local excision with or without RT, a large, randomized,\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled trial (IBIS-II) compared anastrozole (n =\n1471) with tamoxifen (n = 1509).

Most of these studies have found\nthat rates of local control in selected patients, with early-stage breast\ncancer and low risk of recurrence, are equal to those treated with\nWBRT.44,46,186-188 In the NSABP B-39 trial, 10-year cumulative incidence of\nIBTR with APBI was 4.6% compared with 3.9% with WBRT, yielding an\nabsolute difference of 0.7% with an HR of 1.22 (90% CI, 0.94\u20131.58) that\ndid not meet the prespecified criteria for equivalence.43 However, given the\nsmall magnitude in IBTR differences between WBRT and APBI, it is not\nlikely to be of clinical significance in appropriately selected patients.\nQOL, toxicity, and cosmetic outcomes have generally been comparable or\nslightly favored APBI in randomized trials. For example, the IMPORT-LOW\nstudy compared WBRT with partial breast irradiation delivered as 40 Gy in\n15 once-daily fractions using reduced-size breast tangents and found less\nbreast firmness, less change in breast appearance, and lower average\nnumber of adverse events per person with partial breast irradiation.186,189\nThe University of Florence compared WBRT with intensity-modulated\nAPBI (30 Gy in 5 fractions, delivered every other day), and 10-year results\nhave shown that APBI produced less acute and late toxicity and better\ncosmetic outcomes.187 However, the RAPID trial found significantly higher\nrates of fair/poor cosmetic outcome with 3D conformal APBI delivered as\n38.5 Gy in 10 twice-daily fractions.44,190 The majority of APBI patients on\nNSABP B-39 were treated with the same external beam regimen, and\ntreatment-related toxicities were not different for APBI versus WBRT as\ncurrently reported.43 Cosmetic outcome analysis, however, is pending.\nNCCN Recommendation for APBI: The Panel accepts the updated\nASTRO APBI consensus statement for guidance on APBI use.191 The\nNCCN Panel recommends APBI for any BRCA-negative patient who\nmeets the ASTRO 2016 \u201csuitable\u201d criteria defined as age >50 years, ER-\npositive invasive ductal carcinoma measuring \u22642 cm (pT1 disease) with\nnegative margin widths of \u22652 mm, and no lymphovascular invasion (LVI),\nand also permits APBI in patients >50 years of age with screen-detected\nlow- or intermediate-grade DCIS measuring \u22642.5 cm, resected with \u22653 mm\nmargins.

The decision to use systemic\nadjuvant therapy requires considering and balancing risk for disease\nrecurrence with local therapy alone, the magnitude of benefit from\napplying adjuvant therapy, toxicity of the therapy, and comorbidity. The\ndecision-making process requires collaboration between the health care\nteam and patient.\nStratification for Systemic Adjuvant Therapy\nThe NCCN Guidelines stratify, patients with breast cancer based on their\nHR- status and HER2 expression.

Patients with ER-negative, PR-positive cancers may also be\nconsidered for endocrine therapies, however, the efficacy data on this\ngroup are also limited. The same overall interpretation principles apply but\nPR should be interpreted as either positive (if 1%\u2013100% of cells have\nnuclear staining) or negative (if <1% or 0% of cells have nuclear staining).\nFor the purposes of this guideline, any ER and/or PR-positive tumors is\nreferred to as \u2018hormone receptor (HR)-positive\u2019, given that the majority of\nall breast cancers are ER-positive or ER and PR-positive and the\nsubgroup of ER negative/PR-positive tumors are relatively uncommon.\nThe magnitude of risk reduction from adjuvant endocrine therapy is\ndependent on level of ER-expression and on recurrence score (RS) of\ngene expression assay test results.

The AIs are not active in the\ntreatment of patients with functioning ovaries and should not be used in\npatients whose ovarian function cannot reliably be assessed owing to\ntreatment-induced amenorrhea.\nThe results from two prospective, randomized, clinical trials have provided\nevidence of an OS benefit for patients with early-stage breast cancer\nreceiving initial endocrine therapy with tamoxifen followed sequentially by\nanastrozole (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.28\u20130.99; P = .045) or exemestane (HR,\n0.83; 95% CI, 0.69\u20131.00; P = .05 [excluding patients with ER-negative\ndisease]) when compared with tamoxifen as the only endocrine\ntherapy.293,294 In addition, the NCIC-CTG MA-17 trial demonstrated a\nsurvival advantage with extended therapy with letrozole compared with\nplacebo in patients with ALN-positive (but not lymph node-negative),\nER-positive breast cancer.295 Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors have\ndifferent side effect profiles. Both contribute to hot flashes and night\nsweats and may cause vaginal dryness. AIs are more commonly\nassociated with musculoskeletal symptoms, osteoporosis, and increased\nrate of bone fracture, while tamoxifen is associated with an increased risk\nfor uterine cancer and deep venous thrombosis.\nTwo studies have examined initial adjuvant endocrine treatment with either\ntamoxifen or an AI. The ATAC trial demonstrated that anastrozole is\nsuperior to tamoxifen or the combination of tamoxifen and anastrozole in\nthe adjuvant endocrine therapy of postmenopausal patients with\nHR-positive breast cancer.296,297 With a median of 100 months follow-up,\nPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Mansoor Wahid on 6/25/2025 11:49:26 AM.

Patients in the combined tamoxifen\nand anastrozole group gained no benefit over those in the tamoxifen\ngroup, suggesting a possible deleterious effect from the weak estrogenic\neffect of tamoxifen in patients with near complete elimination of\nendogenous estrogen levels.297 ATAC trial sub-protocols show a lesser\neffect of anastrozole compared with tamoxifen on endometrial tissue;299\nsimilar effects of anastrozole and tamoxifen on quality of life, with most\npatients reporting that overall quality of life was not significantly\nimpaired;300 a greater loss of bone mineral density with anastrozole;301 a\nsmall pharmacokinetic interference of anastrozole in the presence of\ntamoxifen of unclear significance;302 and no evidence for an interaction\nbetween prior chemotherapy and anastrozole.303\nBIG 1-98 is a randomized trial testing the use of tamoxifen alone for 5\nyears, letrozole alone for 5 years, or tamoxifen for 2 years followed\nsequentially by letrozole for 3 years, or letrozole for 2 years followed\nsequentially by tamoxifen for 3 years. An early analysis compared\ntamoxifen alone versus letrozole alone, including those patients in the\nsequential arms during their first 2 years of treatment only.304 With 8010\npatients included in the analysis, DFS was superior in the letrozole-treated\npatients (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70\u20130.93; log rank P = .003).

An analysis of the ARNO 95 trial alone after 58 months of\nmedian follow-up demonstrated that switching from tamoxifen to\nanastrozole was associated with significant increases in both DFS (HR,\n0.66; 95% CI, 0.44\u20131.00; P = .049) and OS (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.28\u20130.99;\nP = .045).294 A meta-analysis of ABCSG 8, ARNO 95, and ITA studies\nshowed significant improvement in OS (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52-0.98; P =\n.04) with a switch to anastrozole.312\nThe TEAM trial compared treatment of exemestane alone versus\nsequential therapy of tamoxifen for 2.5 to 3.0 years followed by\nexemestane to complete 5 years of hormone therapy.313 At the end of 5\nyears, 85% of patients in the sequential group versus 86% in the\nexemestane group were disease free (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.88\u20131.08; P =\n.60). This is consistent with the data from the BIG 1-98 trial,307 in which\ntamoxifen followed by letrozole or the reverse sequence of letrozole\nfollowed by tamoxifen was not associated with significant differences in\nefficacy versus letrozole monotherapy after a median follow-up of 71\nmonths.\nThe NCCN panel finds no meaningful differences in terms of efficacy or\ntoxicity between the available AIs: anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane.\nAll three have shown similar anti-tumor efficacy and toxicity profiles in\nrandomized studies in the adjuvant settings.\nOvarian Function Suppression and Endocrine Therapy:\nOvarian function suppression (OFS) is achieved with a\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, oophorectomy, or\novarian irradiation. Available GnRH agonists in the United States include\ngoserelin and leuprolide. OFS is generally considered in those who are\npremenopausal and for tumors with high enough recurrence risk where the\nadditional absolute decrease in recurrence compared with tamoxifen alone\nis worth the additional toxicity (young age, high-grade tumor, lymph node\ninvolvement). A balanced discussion of the risks and benefits associated\nwith OFS is critical, including the potential side effects of premature\nmenopause.\nIn two randomized trials (TEXT and SOFT), premenopausal patients with\nHR-positive early-stage breast cancer were assigned to receive AI\n(exemestane) plus OFS or tamoxifen plus OFS for a period of 5 years.314\nSuppression of ovarian estrogen production was achieved with the use of\nGnRH agonist triptorelin, oophorectomy, or ovarian irradiation. The DFS\nwas 92.8% in the exemestane plus OFS as compared with 88.8% in the\ntamoxifen plus OFS (HR for recurrence, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55\u20130.80; P <\n.001).314 The OS did not differ significantly between the two groups (HR for\ndeath in the exemestane plus OFS group, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.86\u20131.51; P =\n.37).314\nA 9-year median follow-up analysis of the TEXT-SOFT trials showed\nsustained improvements in DFS with exemestane plus OFS versus\ntamoxifen plus OFS  (HR- 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.90) and in distant\nrecurrence-free interval but not OS (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.22).315\nUltimately, with longer follow-up (median = 13 years), an OS was\ndemonstrated for OFS + exemestane in patients with high-risk of\nrecurrence, but not in .exemestane plus OFS in patients with lower risk of\nrelapse not receiving chemotherapy.316\nThe benefit of OFS in premenopausal patients with high-risk of recurrence\nwas also seen in the results of the ASTRRA trial.  This trial studied\npremenopausal patients (n= 1483) with HR-positive breast cancer younger\nthan 45 years treated with surgery and who received chemotherapy (as\nadjuvant or preoperative therapy) and received 5 years of tamoxifen alone\nor 5 years of tamoxifen with OFS for 2 years.

The annual rate of contralateral\nbreast cancer reported was lower with letrozole (0.49% vs. 0.21%; HR\n0.42, 95% CI 0.22-0.81%). However, longer duration of AI resulted in more\nfrequent bone-related adverse effects compared with those who received\nplacebo and no improvement was observed with respect to OS.\nBone-related adverse effects included bone pain (18% vs. 14%), fractures\n(14% vs. 9%), and new-onset osteoporosis (11% vs. 6%).327 Patients with\nhigh-risk of recurrence (eg. those with lymph node involvement) may\nbenefit from extended AI duration (7.5\u201310 years total).328,329\nNCCN Recommendations: The decision of whether or not to extend\nadjuvant treatment based on the evidence available should be\nindividualized. When considering endocrine therapy, the Panel\nrecommends the following adjuvant endocrine therapy options for patients\nwith early-stage breast cancer.\nAdjuvant Endocrine Therapy for Postmenopausal Patients: The NCCN\nPanel recommends AI as initial adjuvant therapy for 5 years (category 1);\nand tamoxifen for 2 to 3 years followed by one of the following options: an\nAI to complete 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy  (category 1) or 5\nyears of AI therapy (category 2B); or tamoxifen for 4.5 to 6 years followed\nby 5 years of AI (category 1) or consideration of tamoxifen for up to 10\nyears. In postmenopausal patients, the use of tamoxifen alone for 5 years\n(category 1) or up to 10 years is limited to those who decline or who have\na contraindication to AIs.\nAdjuvant Endocrine Therapy for Premenopausal Patients: If\npremenopausal at diagnosis, the NCCN Panel recommend 5 years of\ntamoxifen alone (category 1) or tamoxifen with OFS (category 1) or OFS\nplus AI for 5 years (category 1). Patients who are premenopausal at\ndiagnosis and who become amenorrheic with chemotherapy may have\ncontinued estrogen production from the ovaries without menses.\nMenopausal status cannot be determined while receiving OFS. AI can\nstimulate ovarian function.  To assure a true postmenopausal status, serial\nassessment of circulating LH, FSH, and estradiol is mandatory when\nconsidering this subset for AI therapy.330,331 Frequency of testing of\nestradiol and FSH/LH levels should be individualized.\nAfter 5 years of initial endocrine therapy, for patients who are\npostmenopausal at that time (including those who have become\npostmenopausal during the 5 years of tamoxifen therapy), the NCCN\nPanel recommends considering extended therapy with an AI for up to 5\nyears (category 1) or based on the data from the ATLAS trial considering\ntamoxifen for an additional 5 years. For those who remain premenopausal\nafter the initial 5 years of tamoxifen, the panel recommends considering\ncontinuing up to 10 years of tamoxifen therapy.\nAdditional considerations during Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy: Symptom\nmanagement for patients on adjuvant endocrine therapies often requires\ntreatment of hot flashes and the treatment of concurrent depression.\nVenlafaxine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) has\nbeen studied and is an effective intervention in decreasing hot flashes.332-\n335 There is evidence suggesting that concomitant use of tamoxifen with\ncertain SSRIs (eg, paroxetine, fluoxetine) may decrease plasma levels of\nPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Mansoor Wahid on 6/25/2025 11:49:26 AM.

Those with one or two variant alleles with\neither reduced or no activity are designated as intermediate\nmetabolizers and poor metabolizers, respectively. The mild CYP2D6\ninhibitors such as citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, and venlafaxine\nappear to have no or only minimal effect on tamoxifen metabolism.330,338,339\nWith respect to CYP2D6 mutation status, a large retrospective study of\n1325 patients found that time to disease recurrence was significantly\nshortened in poor metabolizers of tamoxifen.340 However, the BIG 1-98\ntrial reported on the outcome based on CYP2D6 genotype in a subset of\npostmenopausal patients with endocrine-responsive, early invasive breast\ncancer. The study found no correlation between CYP2D6 allelic status and\ndisease outcome or between CYP2D6 allelic status and tamoxifen-related\nadverse effects.341 A genetic analysis of the ATAC trial found no\nassociation between CYP2D6 genotype and clinical outcomes.342,343\nGiven the limited and conflicting evidence at this time,344 the NCCN Breast\nCancer Panel does not recommend CYP2D6 testing as a tool to determine\nthe optimal adjuvant endocrine strategy. This recommendation is\nconsistent with the ASCO Guidelines.345 When prescribing a selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitor  (SSRI), it is reasonable to avoid potent and\nintermediate CYP2D6 inhibiting agents, particularly paroxetine and\nfluoxetine, if an appropriate alternative exists.\nFor those on tamoxifen, while age-appropriate gynecologic screening is\nrecommended, the use of routine annual pelvic ultrasound is not\nrecommended. For those receiving AI or who experience ovarian failure\nsecondary to treatment should have monitoring of bone health with a bone\nmineral density determination at baseline and periodically thereafter. .The\npanel discourages the selective ER modulators to treat osteoporosis or\nosteopenia in patients with breast cancer. The use of a bisphosphonate\n(oral/IV) or denosumab is recommended to maintain or to improve bone\nmineral density and reduce risk of fractures in postmenopausal (natural or\ninduced) patients receiving adjuvant AI therapy. Optimal duration of either\ntherapy has not been established. The optimal duration and benefits\nbeyond 3 years is not known. Factors to consider for duration of anti-\nosteoporosis therapy include bone mineral density, response to therapy,\nand risk factors for continued bone loss or fracture. There are case reports\nof spontaneous fractures after denosumab discontinuation. Patients\ntreated with bisphosphonates or denosumab should undergo a dental\nexamination with preventive dentistry prior to the initiation of therapy, and\nshould take supplemental calcium and vitamin D.\nThe incremental benefit of adding adjuvant chemotherapy to endocrine\ntherapy in patients with low clinical risk of recurrence such as those with\nvery small, low grade, lymph node-negative tumors is relatively small.346\nThe decision whether or not to administer adjuvant chemotherapy in\npatients with HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors is based on many\nfactors including lymph node status, size, grade, lymphovascular invasion,\nage, comorbid conditions and/or the results of a gene expression profile\ntest using multigene assays.\nSeveral commercially-available gene-based assays are useful in\ndetermining prognosis by predicting distant recurrence, local recurrence,\nor survival. Of these, only one, the 21-gene assay (Oncotype Dx) has\nbeen clinically validated for predicting the benefit of adding adjuvant\nchemotherapy to further reduce the risk of recurrence.\n21-gene assay (Oncotype DX) in Node-negative, HR-positive,\nHER2-negative disease: The 21-gene recurrence score (RS) is one of the\nmost validated multigene assays.

Furthermore,  the HERA trial416\nand the combined analysis of the NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 trials417\nshowed significant improvement in OS with the use of trastuzumab. A\nmore recent meta-analysis of all the above (excluding the BCIRG 006\nTrial) showed that addition of trastuzumab resulted in an average absolute\nreduction in 10-year risk of recurrence of 9.0% (95% CI 7.4 to 10.7; P < .\n0001), a reduction in 10-year breast cancer mortality by 6.4% (4.9 to 7.8;\nP < .0001), and a reduction in mortality (all causes) by 6.5% (5.0 to 8.0; P\n<.0001).418 The benefits of trastuzumab are independent of ER\nstatus.412,419\nThe NCCN Panel considers it reasonable to incorporate pertuzumab into\nthe above adjuvant regimens272,420,421\nThe results of theTRAIN-2 trial showed high pCR rates after treatment\nregimen with anthracycline plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab (67%) and\nalso without anthracycline plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab (68%).420\nPatients who received anthracycline-containing regimen experienced more\nfebrile neutropenia, hypokalemia, and left ventricular ejection fraction\n(LVEF) decline to grade 2 or worse (\u226510% or to <50%).420\nA follow-up analysis of the TRAIN-2 study showed similar 3-year EFS and\nOS with or without anthracyclines in patients with stage II and III HER2-\npositive breast cancer. Based on these results, considering the added\ntoxicity of anthracycline containing regimens the panel has added non-\nanthracycline containing regimens with trastuzumab and pertuzumab as\ntreatment options.422\nThe NCCN panel has included the following regimen as other\nrecommended regimens for HER2-positive disease:\ndoxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by docetaxel + trastuzumab\n(followed by docetaxel + trastuzumab); AC followed by docetaxel +\ntrastuzumab + pertuzumab and paclitaxel/carboplatin + trastuzumab +\npertuzumab.\nRegimens Useful in Certain Circumstances:\nOne year of extended therapy with neratinib after completion of 1 year of\nadjuvant trastuzumab without pertuzumab was evaluated in the phase III\nExteNET trial.  Neratinib improved invasive DFS (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57-\n0.92, P = .0083) primarily in the subgroup of HR-positive tumors (HR 0.60,\n95% CI 0.43-0.83, P = .063).

There are rare\nsubtypes of metaplastic carcinoma (eg, low-grade adenosquamous and\nlow-grade fibromatosis-like carcinoma) that have a favorable prognosis\neven without administration of adjuvant systemic therapies.\nThe vast majority of pure tubular, pure mucinous, and pure cribriform\nbreast cancers are both ER-positive and HER2-negative. To be\nassociated with favorable prognosis, the favorable histologic type should\nnot be high grade, should be pure (>90% as classified on the surgical\nexcision, not core biopsy alone), and should be HER-2 negative. If atypical\npathologic or clinical features are present, consider treating as ductal/NST.\nThe pathology evaluation and accuracy of the ER and/or HER2\ndetermination should be reviewed if these are ER-negative and/or\nHER2-positive, or if a tumor with an ER- and PR-negative status is grade\n1.276 Should a breast cancer be histologically identified as a pure tubular or\nmucinous breast cancer and be confirmed as ER-negative, then the tumor\nshould be treated according to the guideline for the usual histology,\nER-negative breast cancers.

Of these,\npatients with disease progression (n = 17) continued to receive\npertuzumab with the addition of trastuzumab.

Median time to progression was 3.3 months with\nletrozole and 14.1 months with trastuzumab plus letrozole. The results are\nconsistent with the TAnDEM trial; however, due to smaller numbers of\npatients enrolled in this trial, this was not statistically significant (HR, 0.67;\n95% CI, 0.35\u20131.29; P = .23).573\nIn a phase III study of postmenopausal patients (n = 219) with HER2-\npositive and HR-positive disease, first-line treatment with lapatinib plus\nletrozole reduced the risk of disease progression compared to treatment\nwith letrozole alone (median PFS, 8.2 months vs. 3.0 months; HR, 0.71;\n95% CI, 0.53\u20130.96; P = .019).574 The combination of letrozole plus\ntrastuzumab was associated with a higher rate of grade 3 or grade 4\ntoxicities, including diarrhea (10% vs. 1%) and rash (1% vs. 0%).574\nIn the randomized phase II study (PERTAIN), postmenopausal patients (n\n= 258) were randomly assigned to either first-line pertuzumab plus\ntrastuzumab and an AI (anastrozole or letrozole) or trastuzumab plus an\nAI. There was an improvement in PFS with the three-drug combination\n(18.9 vs. 15.8 months; HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.48\u20130.89).575 Grade 3 or higher\nadverse events observed were higher trastuzumab and pertuzumab\nversus pertuzumab alone (50% vs. 39%). Of note, about half of patients\nreceived induction therapy with a taxane for 18 to 24 weeks prior to the\ninitiation of endocrine therapy. Based on the results of the PERTAIN\ntrial,575 the NCCN Panel notes that if treatment was initiated with\nchemotherapy and trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, and the chemotherapy\nwas stopped, endocrine therapy may be added to the trastuzumab plus\npertuzumab.\nIn the ALTERNATIVE trial, postmenopausal patients (n = 355) with\nHER2-positive, HR-positive metastatic breast cancer were randomized to\nreceive lapatinib plus trastuzumab plus an AI, lapatinib plus an AI, or\ntrastuzumab plus an AI without chemotherapy.576 All patients in the trial\nreceived prior trastuzumab and prior endocrine therapy, either in the\nadjuvant or metastatic disease setting. An AI in combination with lapatinib\nplus trastuzumab demonstrated a significant increase in PFS compared\nwith trastuzumab without lapatinib (11 vs. 5.7 months; HR, 0.62; 95% CI,\n0.45\u20130.88, P = .0064).576 The most common adverse events with the\ncombination compared with trastuzumab or lapatinib monotherapy were\ndiarrhea (69%, 9%, 51%), rash (36%, 2%, 28%), nausea (22%, 9%, 22%),\nand paronychia (30%, 0%, 15%).\nThe NCCN Panel has also included other combinations of available\nendocrine therapies such as fulvestrant or tamoxifen with trastuzumab as\noptions for HR-positive and HER2-positive metastatic disease. These\noptions would be mostly considered after completion of chemotherapy\nplus HER2-therapy or in a few patients with indolent or asymptomatic\ndisease based on the need for continuing HER2-targeted therapy for\ndisease control.

On this page, the terms males and females refer to sex assigned at birth.\n\u2022 Few males have been included in breast cancer trials.1 Therefore, recommendations regarding management of breast cancer in males are\ngenerally extrapolated from findings of clinical trials focusing on breast cancer in females.\n\u2022 Although there are some biologic and clinical differences between breast cancer in males and females, management of breast cancer in\nmales is similar overall to management of breast cancer in females, with the following special considerations pertinent to male patients2:\n\u0017Genetics: The NCCN Panel recommends consideration of genetic testing for all males with breast cancer (See NCCN Guidelines for\nGenetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, Pancreatic, and Prostate).\n\u0017Breast surgery: Historically, males with breast cancer have undergone mastectomy more often than BCS. However, breast-conservation\ntherapy is increasingly being performed in males and evolving data indicate that breast conservation in males is associated with\nequivalent outcomes to mastectomy and that it is safe and feasible. Decisions about breast conservation versus mastectomy in males\nshould be made according to similar criteria as for females.2-9\n\u0017Axillary lymph node surgery: As in females, SLNB should be performed in the setting of male breast cancer with a clinically node-negative\naxilla.2,4\n\u0017RT: Indications for radiation after breast surgery in males with breast cancer are the same as for females with breast cancer.2,5,10,11\n\u0017Use of molecular assays: Data are limited regarding the use of molecular assays to assess prognosis and to predict benefit from\nchemotherapy in males with breast cancer.2 Available data suggest the 21-gene assay recurrence score provides prognostic information\nin males with breast cancer.12,13\n\u0017Preoperative/adjuvant systemic therapy: Chemotherapy with/without HER2-targeted therapy should be recommended for males with\nbreast cancer according to guidelines for females with breast cancer.2 Options for adjuvant endocrine therapy for males with breast\ncancer include tamoxifen for 5\u201310 years or, if tamoxifen is contraindicated, a GnRH analog plus an aromatase inhibitor. In males, single-\nagent adjuvant treatment with an aromatase inhibitor has been associated with inferior outcomes compared to tamoxifen alone, likely due\nto inadequate estradiol suppression, and is not recommended.2,14-17\n\u0017Follow-up after treatment for early-stage disease: There are only limited data to support screening for breast cancer in males.2 The NCCN\nPanel recommends that bone density be assessed at baseline and every 2 years in males with breast cancer who receive adjuvant GnRH\nanalog therapy. Low bone density should be managed according to standard guidelines.18\n\u0017Systemic therapy for advanced disease: Management of advanced breast cancer in males is similar to that in females; however, it is\npreferred that when an aromatase inhibitor is used, a GnRH analog should be given concurrently.2 Available data suggest single-agent\nfulvestrant has similar efficacy in males as in females.19 CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant,\nmTOR inhibitors, and PIK3CA inhibitors have not been systematically evaluated in clinical trials in males with breast cancer. However,\navailable real-world data suggest comparable efficacy and safety profiles and it is reasonable to recommend these agents to males\nbased on extrapolation of data from studies comprised largely of female participants with advanced breast cancer. Indications for and\nrecommendations regarding chemotherapy, HER2-targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and PARP inhibitors for advanced breast cancer in\nmales are similar to those for advanced breast cancer in females.1\nReferences on BINV-J 2 of 2\nPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Mansoor Wahid on 6/25/2025 11:49:26 AM.

The correlation between pathologic response and long-\nterm outcome is strongest for TNBC, somewhat less so for HER2-positive disease, and least for ER-positive disease.c,d\n\u2022 A number of chemotherapy regimens have activity in the preoperative setting. In general, those chemotherapy regimens recommended in\nthe adjuvant setting may be considered in the preoperative setting. See Preoperative/Adjuvant Therapy Regimens (BINV-M).\n\u2022 Preoperative endocrine therapy alone may be considered for patients with ER-positive disease based on comorbidities or low-risk luminal\nbiology based on clinical characteristics and/or genomic signatures (until desired effect is achieved). Data shows that optimal duration for\nresponse if achieved between 4\u20136 months.e\n\u2022 Patients with HER-2 positive, \u2265cT2 and/or cN+ should be considered for HER2-directed therapy preoperatively. See Preoperative/Adjuvant\nTherapy Regimens (BINV-M).\n\u2022 Some studies suggest an increased risk of locoregional recurrence following use of preoperative chemotherapy.f These trials delivered\nchemotherapy regimens that are no longer standard, did not include targeted therapies, did not use modern imaging techniques, and/or\nused non-standard locoregional management. Care should be taken to follow the procedures outlined in BINV-12 and BINV-14 to assure\nappropriate locoregional management. Not all patients are appropriate candidates for preoperative systemic therapy. Accurate clinical\nstaging at baseline prior to initiation of preoperative systemic therapy is critical. See Potentially Operable Disease: Breast and Axillary\nEvaluation Prior to Preoperative Systemic Therapy (BINV-12).\n\u2022 Tumor response should be routinely assessed by clinical exam and imaging studies (see footnote uu on BINV-13) during delivery of\npreoperative therapy. It is preferred that the standard regimen is completed prior to surgery. If all intended treatment is not completed prior\nto surgery, the remainder may be given in the adjuvant setting. Patients with operable breast cancer experiencing progression of disease\nduring preoperative systemic therapy may be given an alternate systemic regimen or proceed to surgery if deemed resectable.

The mild CYP2D6\ninhibitors such as citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, and venlafaxine\nappear to have no or only minimal effect on tamoxifen metabolism.330,338,339\nWith respect to CYP2D6 mutation status, a large retrospective study of\n1325 patients found that time to disease recurrence was significantly\nshortened in poor metabolizers of tamoxifen.340 However, the BIG 1-98\ntrial reported on the outcome based on CYP2D6 genotype in a subset of\npostmenopausal patients with endocrine-responsive, early invasive breast\ncancer.

This recommendation is\nconsistent with the ASCO Guidelines.345 When prescribing a selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitor  (SSRI), it is reasonable to avoid potent and\nintermediate CYP2D6 inhibiting agents, particularly paroxetine and\nfluoxetine, if an appropriate alternative exists.\nFor those on tamoxifen, while age-appropriate gynecologic screening is\nrecommended, the use of routine annual pelvic ultrasound is not\nrecommended. For those receiving AI or who experience ovarian failure\nsecondary to treatment should have monitoring of bone health with a bone\nmineral density determination at baseline and periodically thereafter. .The\npanel discourages the selective ER modulators to treat osteoporosis or\nosteopenia in patients with breast cancer. The use of a bisphosphonate\n(oral/IV) or denosumab is recommended to maintain or to improve bone\nmineral density and reduce risk of fractures in postmenopausal (natural or\ninduced) patients receiving adjuvant AI therapy. Optimal duration of either\ntherapy has not been established. The optimal duration and benefits\nbeyond 3 years is not known. Factors to consider for duration of anti-\nosteoporosis therapy include bone mineral density, response to therapy,\nand risk factors for continued bone loss or fracture. There are case reports\nof spontaneous fractures after denosumab discontinuation. Patients\ntreated with bisphosphonates or denosumab should undergo a dental\nexamination with preventive dentistry prior to the initiation of therapy, and\nshould take supplemental calcium and vitamin D.\nThe incremental benefit of adding adjuvant chemotherapy to endocrine\ntherapy in patients with low clinical risk of recurrence such as those with\nvery small, low grade, lymph node-negative tumors is relatively small.346\nThe decision whether or not to administer adjuvant chemotherapy in\npatients with HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors is based on many\nfactors including lymph node status, size, grade, lymphovascular invasion,\nage, comorbid conditions and/or the results of a gene expression profile\ntest using multigene assays.\nSeveral commercially-available gene-based assays are useful in\ndetermining prognosis by predicting distant recurrence, local recurrence,\nor survival.

Predictors of poor\nadherence to medication include the presence of side effects associated\nwith the medication, and incomplete understanding by the patient of the\nbenefits associated with regular administration of the medication.437 The\nPanel recommends the implementation of simple strategies to enhance\npatient adherence to endocrine therapy, such as direct questioning of the\npatient during office visits, as well as brief, clear explanations on the value\nof taking the medication regularly and the therapeutic importance of longer\ndurations of endocrine therapy.\nLymphedema is a common complication after treatment for breast\ncancer. Factors associated with increased risk of lymphedema include\nextent of axillary surgery, axillary radiation, infection, and patient\nobesity.438,439 The Panel recommends educating the patients on\nlymphedema, monitoring for lymphedema, and referring for lymphedema\nmanagement as needed.\nMany young patients treated for breast cancer maintain or regain\npremenopausal status following treatment for breast cancer. For these\npatients, the NCCN Panel discourages the use of hormonal birth control\nmethods, regardless of the HR status of the tumor.440 Alternative birth\ncontrol methods are recommended, including intrauterine devices, barrier\nmethods, and, for those with no intent of future pregnancy, tubal ligation or\nvasectomy. Breastfeeding during endocrine or chemotherapy treatment is\nnot recommended by the NCCN Panel because of risks to the infant.\nBreastfeeding after breast-conserving treatment for breast cancer is not\ncontraindicated. However, lactation from an irradiated breast may not be\npossible, or may occur only with a diminished capacity.440,441\nThe Panel recommends that patients on an adjuvant AI or who experience\novarian failure secondary to treatment should have monitoring of bone\nhealth with a bone mineral density determination at baseline and\nperiodically thereafter. The use of estrogen, progesterone, or selective ER\nmodulators to treat osteoporosis or osteopenia in patients with breast\ncancer is discouraged. The use of a bisphosphonate is generally the\npreferred intervention to improve bone mineral density. A single phase 3\nstudy, ABCSG12, demonstrated improved outcomes with the addition of\nzoledronic acid in premenopausal patients receiving endocrine therapy\nwith ovarian suppression.442 Use of bisphosphonates in such patients and\nin other subgroups remains controversial. Denosumab has shown to\nsignificantly reduce fractures in postmenopausal patients receiving\nadjuvant therapy AIs, and improves bone mineral density.378\nOptimal duration of bisphosphonate therapy has not been established.\nFactors to consider for duration of anti-osteoporosis therapy include bone\nmineral density, response to therapy, and risk factors for continued bone\nloss or fracture. Patients treated with a bisphosphonate should undergo a\ndental examination with preventive dentistry prior to the initiation of\ntherapy, and should take supplemental calcium and vitamin D.\nEvidence suggests that a healthy lifestyle may lead to better breast cancer\noutcomes. A nested case control study of 369 patients with ER-positive\ntumors who developed a second primary breast cancer compared with\n734 matched control patients who did not develop a second primary tumor\nshowed an association between obesity (body mass index [BMI] \u226530),\nsmoking, and alcohol consumption and contralateral breast cancer.443 A\nprospective study of 1490 patients diagnosed with stage I\u2013III breast\ncancer showed an association between high fruit and vegetable\nconsumption, physical activity, and improved survivorship, regardless of\nobesity.444 There is emerging evidence that obesity is associated with\npoorer outcomes for certain subtypes of breast cancers.

Therefore,\ntreatments associated with minimal toxicity are preferred. Thus, the use of\nthe minimally toxic endocrine therapies is preferred to the use of cytotoxic\ntherapy whenever reasonable.479 Guidance for treatment of patients with\nbreast cancer and brain metastases is included the NCCN Guidelines for\nCentral Nervous System Cancers.\nPatients with recurrent or stage IV breast cancer at diagnosis are initially\nstratified according to whether bone metastases are present. These two\npatient subsets (those with and without bony metastases) are then further\nstratified by tumor HR and HER2 status.\nTherapy for Bone Metastases\nComplications from bone metastases include pain, decreased\nperformance status, and decreased QOL, as well as skeletal-related\nevents (SREs), which are defined as the need for radiation or surgery to\nbone, pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia of\nmalignancy.\nThe NCCN Panel recommends treatment with a bone-modifying agent\nsuch as zoledronic acid, pamidronate, or denosumab (category 1) in\naddition to chemotherapy or endocrine therapy if bone metastasis is\npresent; expected survival is \u22653 months. Patients should undergo a dental\nexamination with preventive dentistry prior to initiation of this therapy. The\nbisphosphonates and denosumab are associated with a risk of\ndevelopment of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). Poor baseline dental\nhealth or dental procedures during treatment are known risk factors for\nONJ. Thus, a dental examination with preventive dentistry intervention is\nrecommended prior to treatment with intravenous bisphosphonate or\ndenosumab, and dental procedures invasive of gum or bone during\ntreatment should be avoided if at all possible. Additional risk factors for the\ndevelopment of ONJ include administration of chemotherapy or\ncorticosteroids and poor oral hygiene with periodontal disease and dental\nabscess.480"

      "tests": "Monitoring the treatment of metastatic breast cancer involves a wide array\nof assessments and the need for the clinician to integrate several different\nforms of information to decide on the effectiveness of treatment and the\nacceptability of toxicity. The information includes those from direct\nobservations of the patient, including patient-reported symptoms,\nperformance status, change in weight, and physical examination;\nlaboratory tests such as alkaline phosphatase, liver function, blood counts,\nand calcium; radiographic imaging; functional imaging; and, where\nappropriate, tumor biomarkers. The results of these evaluations generally\nare classified as response, continued response to treatment, stable\ndisease, uncertainty regarding disease status, or progression of disease.\nThe clinician typically must assess and balance multiple different forms of\ninformation to decide, along with the patient, whether disease is being\ncontrolled and the toxicity of treatment is acceptable. Sometimes individual\npieces of information can be conflicting with regard to disease response,\nand clinical judgment along with patient input is critical.\nThe NCCN Panel recommends using widely accepted criteria for reporting\nresponse, stability, and progression of disease such as the RECIST\ncriteria643 and the WHO criteria.644 The Panel also recommends using the\nsame method of response assessment over time. For example, an\nabnormality initially found on diagnostic CT scan of the chest should be\nmonitored with repeat diagnostic CT scans of the chest.\nThe optimal frequency of testing is uncertain and primarily based on the\nmonitoring strategies utilized in breast cancer clinical trials. The page titled\nPrinciples of Monitoring Metastatic Disease in the algorithm provides a\ntable outlining general recommendations for the frequency and type of\nmonitoring as a baseline before initiation of a new therapy, for monitoring\nthe effectiveness of cytotoxic chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, and\nas an assessment when there is evidence of disease progression.

At\nthis time, based on current data the panel recommends against CYP2D6 gene testing for\npatients being considered for tamoxifen therapy.\ni In patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, 1) for those with high-risk\nbreast cancer (ie, those with \u22654 positive lymph nodes (confirmed preoperatively and/\nor at surgery), or 1\u20133 positive lymph nodes with either grade 3 disease or tumor size\n\u22655 cm (on pre-operative imaging and/or at surgery), 2 years of adjuvant abemaciclib\ncan be considered in combination with endocrine therapy (category 1, preferred).\nVTE risk should be considered when combining abemaciclib with tamoxifen. 2) For\nthose with any lymph node involvement (excluding microscopic nodal involvement),\nor if no nodal involvement either tumor size >5 cm, or if tumor size 2-5 cm, either\nGrade 2 (and high genomic risk or Ki-67 \u226520%), or Grade 3, 3 years of ribociclib\nwith aromatase inhibitor may be considered (Category 1, preferred). Notably\nadjuvant CDK4/6 inhibitors have been studied in high-risk patients who mostly\nreceived adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy; there are limited data in those who\ndid not receive chemotherapy. In patients eligible for adjuvant olaparib (see BINV-L)\nand abemaciclib or ribociclib, the benefit and optimal sequence is not known.\nj The three selective aromatase inhibitors (ie, anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane)\nhave shown similar anti-tumor efficacy and toxicity profiles in randomized studies in\nthe adjuvant and preoperative settings. The optimal duration of aromatase inhibitors\nin adjuvant therapy is uncertain. Patients with lymph node involvement may benefit\nfrom extended aromatase inhibitor duration (7.5\u201310 years total).\nk If patient is not postmenopausal, sequential evaluation of hormonal status is\nrecommended to consider an alternative endocrine agent.\nADJUVANT ENDOCRINE \u00b1 CDK4/6 INHIBITOR THERAPY"

Preoperative systemic therapy should not\nbe offered in patients with extensive in situ disease when the extent of\ninvasive disease cannot be defined; in patients where the extent of the\ntumor is poorly delineated; or in those whose tumors are not clinically\nassessable. The decision to utilize preoperative therapy should be made\nin the context of a coordinated and collaborative multi-disciplinary team.\nFor predicting the response of pre-operative endocrine therapy for\npostmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative, cN0 breast\ncancer, data from the TransNEOS study demonstrate a significant\ncorrelation between 21 gene assay Recurrence Score and clinical\nresponse to preoperative letrozole.  Those whose tumors had a\nRecurrence Score between 0-17 were significantly more likely to respond\nto preoperative letrozole compared with Recurrence Score of 31-100.258\nFor predicting the response to pre-operative chemotherapy for post-\nmenopausal, ER-positive, HER2-negative patients with T1/T2, node\nnegative tumors, another study evaluated the role of the Recurrence\nScore with pathologic response rates after pre-operative systemic therapy.\nTheir findings suggest high Recurrence Scores are associated with a\nhigher likelihood of pCR after preoperative chemotherapy.259\nBased on the above two studies that showed the use of 21-gene\nRecurrence Score in predicting response to preoperative chemotherapy,\n258,259 the NCCN panel has added a footnote for considering the use of a\ngene expression assay  during workup when contemplating preoperative\nendocrine or systemic therapy for postmenopausal patients with cN0,\noperable ER-positive, HER2-negative disease, to aid in predicting\nresponse to preoperative therapy.\nPreoperative therapy options:\nChemotherapy: A number of chemotherapy regimens have activity in the\npreoperative setting. According to the NCCN Panel, those regimens\nrecommended in the adjuvant setting may be considered in the\npreoperative setting. In both settings, the underlying aim remains the\nsame: eradication or control of undiscovered distant metastases.\nEndocrine Therapy: Preoperative endocrine therapy alone may be offered\nto those with strongly HR-positive tumors based on comorbidities or low-\nrisk luminal biology based on clinical characteristics and/or genomic\nsignatures (until desired effect is achieved).260-267 The results of the\nACOSOG Z1031 trial show that preoperative endocrine therapy is\neffective in reducing residual disease and enabling BCS for many patients\nwith low rates of local-regional recurrence post-surgery. 268\nAccording to the NCCN Panel, the endocrine therapy options include an\naromatase inhibitor (with ovarian function suppression (OFS) for\npremenopausal patients) or tamoxifen (with or without OFS for\npremenopausal patients). The preferred endocrine therapy option for\npostmenopausal patients is an aromatase inhibitor. The panel has added\na comment that the optimal response to endocrine therapy, if achieved is\nanywhere between 4-6 months based on the above trials.\nHER2-Targeted Therapy: For patients with HER2-positive breast cancer,\nthat are candidates for preoperative systemic therapy, chemotherapy and\ntrastuzumab-based therapy is recommended.269 Chemotherapy and dual\nanti-HER2 blockade associated with trastuzumab plus pertuzumab has\nshown significant improvements in the pCR rate when compared with\nchemotherapy and trastuzumab in the preoperative setting.\nPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Mansoor Wahid on 6/25/2025 11:49:26 AM.
