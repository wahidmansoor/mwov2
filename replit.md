# OncoVista AI - Clinical Decision Support Platform

## Project Overview
OncoVista AI is a comprehensive medical-grade oncology platform providing AI-powered clinical decision support, role-based access control, and multi-module healthcare workflows. This is strictly a clinical decision-support system for educational and guidance purposes - NOT an EHR system.
