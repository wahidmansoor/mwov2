    "questionText": "A 45-year-old woman with newly diagnosed invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast has the following pathology: T1c (1.8 cm), N0, M0, ER 90%, PR 80%, HER2 1+, Ki-67 15%. According to NCCN guidelines, what is the most appropriate next step?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Start adjuvant chemotherapy followed by hormone therapy",
      "B": "Order Oncotype DX recurrence score testing",
      "C": "Begin immediate hormone therapy with tamoxifen",
      "D": "Refer for neoadjuvant chemotherapy"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "rationale": "For hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, node-negative breast cancer (T1-3), NCCN guidelines recommend consideration of multigene assays like Oncotype DX to guide adjuvant treatment decisions. This is particularly important for T1c tumors where the benefit of chemotherapy may be marginal.",
    "explanationDetail": "The Oncotype DX assay provides a recurrence score that helps predict the likelihood of distant recurrence and the potential benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Scores are categorized as low risk (<11), intermediate risk (11-25), and high risk (>25). This patient's profile (T1c, N0, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, relatively low Ki-67) makes her an ideal candidate for multigene testing to avoid unnecessary chemotherapy toxicity.",

    "explanationDetail": "The IMpower133 study demonstrated that adding atezolizumab to carboplatin/etoposide significantly improved overall survival (12.3 vs 10.3 months, HR 0.70) and progression-free survival in treatment-naive extensive-stage SCLC patients. This regimen is now NCCN Category 1 recommendation for extensive-stage disease.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "rationale": "For localized high-grade osteosarcoma, NCCN guidelines recommend neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection. This approach allows for assessment of chemotherapy response, potential tumor downsizing, and time for limb-salvage planning.",
    "explanationDetail": "Standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy for osteosarcoma includes combinations such as doxorubicin/cisplatin, high-dose methotrexate, and ifosfamide. The degree of necrosis after neoadjuvant therapy (â‰¥90% necrosis indicates good response) is a strong prognostic factor. Limb-salvage surgery is preferred when oncologically safe and functionally superior to amputation.",
