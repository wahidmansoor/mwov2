# Replit Project Migration and Deployment Setup

I have established an SSH connection from my Replit project to Cursor IDE. I need help with the following tasks:

## ROADMAP OVERVIEW

### Phase 1: Analysis & Setup (15-20 mins)
1. **Project Structure Analysis**
   - Identify current tech stack and dependencies
   - Map out file structure and key components
   - Identify current database setup and queries
   - Note any environment variables and configurations
   - Document current deployment method

2. **Environment Assessment**
   - Check for package.json and dependency versions
   - Identify build processes and scripts
   - Note any backend/API endpoints
   - Assess current authentication system

### Phase 2: Localhost Copy Creation (10-15 mins)
1. Create clean localhost version
2. Set up proper local development environment
3. Test localhost functionality
4. Document local setup process

### Phase 3: Combined Modification (30-40 mins)
1. **Supabase Integration (20-25 mins)**
   - Set up Supabase project and get credentials
   - Replace database connections
   - Migrate schemas and data structure
   - Update all database operations
   - Test database connectivity

2. **Netlify Optimization (15-20 mins)**
   - Configure build settings
   - Set up netlify.toml
   - Optimize for static deployment
   - Configure environment variables
   - Set up redirects/rewrites

3. **Integration Testing (5-10 mins)**
   - Test Supabase + Netlify compatibility
   - Verify all features work together

### Phase 4: Documentation & Deployment (10-15 mins)
1. Create deployment guides
2. Test actual Netlify deployment
3. Provide troubleshooting documentation

## DETAILED TASK BREAKDOWN

## Task 1: Create Localhost Copy
- Analyze the current Replit project structure and dependencies
- Create a complete localhost-compatible version of the project
- Ensure all environment variables and configurations are properly mapped for local development
- Set up proper package.json with all required dependencies
- Create a local development setup guide with installation and run instructions

## Task 2: Download Project Copy
- Provide instructions or scripts to download/clone the entire project locally
- Ensure all assets, files, and folder structures are preserved
- Include any hidden files or configurations that might be needed

## Task 3: Create One Modified Version (Supabase + Netlify Ready)

### Combined Version: Supabase Database + Netlify Deployment
- Replace the current database setup with Supabase integration
- Set up Supabase client configuration
- Modify all database queries and operations to work with Supabase
- Update environment variables for Supabase connection (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, etc.)
- Implement proper authentication if needed
- Update any ORM configurations or database schemas
- Provide migration scripts or setup instructions for Supabase

**AND simultaneously configure for Netlify deployment:**
- Set up proper build scripts and commands optimized for Netlify
- Create netlify.toml configuration file with appropriate settings
- Ensure all environment variables (including Supabase vars) are properly configured for Netlify
- Set up redirects and rewrites if needed (especially for SPAs)
- Optimize build process for Netlify's requirements
- Configure Netlify Edge Functions or serverless functions for any backend functionality that works with Supabase
- Set up proper headers and security configurations
- Ensure static assets are properly handled
- Make sure Supabase integration works seamlessly in Netlify's deployment environment

## Additional Requirements:
- Maintain code quality and existing functionality in both versions (localhost + modified)
- Provide clear documentation for each version
- Include troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Ensure the modified version follows best practices for both Supabase and Netlify
- Create separate README files for localhost and the Supabase+Netlify version
- Ensure the combined version works seamlessly with both Supabase backend and Netlify hosting

Please analyze my current project structure first, then proceed systematically following this roadmap:

**EXECUTION ORDER:**
1. Start with Phase 1 analysis and show me the findings
2. Proceed to Phase 2 localhost setup only after confirmation
3. Move to Phase 3 modifications step by step (Supabase first, then Netlify)
4. Complete with Phase 4 documentation and testing

**DELIVERABLES EXPECTED:**
- [ ] Project analysis report
- [ ] Working localhost copy with setup instructions  
- [ ] Modified version with Supabase integration
- [ ] Same version optimized for Netlify deployment
- [ ] Complete documentation for both versions
- [ ] Deployment checklist and troubleshooting guide

Please confirm you understand the roadmap and start with Phase 1 analysis.
